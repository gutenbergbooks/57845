<div class="chapter"><h2>PREFACE</h2></div>

<p>Despite Francis Bacon’s dictum that “prefaces are great wastes of
time, and, though they seem to proceed of modesty, they are bravery,”
I hazard a few words as to this book, which, like Topsy, “growed, I
’spects,” from a chance request for a quotation from Homer on Fishing
with a Rod for my sister’s game-book.</p>

<p>It is, as far as I can discover, the first attempt to examine
classical and other ancient writers on Fishing from the standpoint of
one who has not only been a practical Pisciculturist for many years
and an Angler all his life, but has also been taught (though somewhat
forgotten) his Greek and Latin.</p>

<p>If my work, in the main, is necessarily based on the compilations of
others, it yet by serendipity (to adopt Horace Walpole’s mintage) has
unearthed some rare authors, who, judging from lack of mention, were
unknown to previous writers on the subject. It contains also—if I
may venture a “bravery”—several points which are apparently original.</p>

<p>Instances of these are:—</p>

<p class="blockquot1">(1) The definite establishment of Aristotle as our first,
if through lack of microscope primitive, scale-reader;</p>

<p class="blockquot1">(2) The acquittal without a stain on his character of
Plutarch from the charge, under which he has lain for
centuries, of libelling and contemning Fishing;</p>

<p class="blockquot1">(3) The discussion by whom, Martial or Ælian, was the use
of (<i>a</i>) the natural, or (<i>b</i>) the artificial fly first
suggested or implied;</p>

<p class="blockquot1">(4) The examination whether the <i>crescens harundo</i> of
Martial was a jointed Rod, somewhat like our own;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot1">(5) The conclusion that the Rod was apparently never
employed by the Ancient Assyrians or the Israelites, despite
their long connection with Egypt, where as early as <i>c.</i> 2000
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> it is depicted in actual use;</p>

<p class="blockquot1">(6) The point which, if not original, is rarely made or
insufficiently pressed, that the Line of both the ancients
and moderns down till the seventeenth century was a <i>tight</i>,
as opposed to a <i>running</i> Line.</p>

<p>May I, as a last “bravery,” state that apart from articles in
Magazines and Encyclopædias, I do not know, with the exception
of Bates’s <i>Ancient Egyptian Fishing</i>, of any work in English on
<i>Fishing</i>, not Fish, in ancient Egypt, Assyria, Palestine, or China,
nor, with the exception of Mainzer’s magazine article on Jewish
Fishing, have I come across one in French or German?</p>

<p>If any object that I have cast my net too wide and enclosed a few
things that are neither Fish nor Fishing, I must insist that as
these waters are not, as yet, adequately charted, it is well-nigh
impossible to avoid some infringement of the three miles’ territorial
limit. To drop metaphor, in the present state of archæological
research, it is notorious that no one subject can be fully
investigated without trenching here and there on allied topics. This
indeed is not merely necessary, but desirable, unless important
side-lights are simply to be ignored.</p>

<p>Moreover, every good Waltonian prefers the discursive to the cursive
style, and would rather take part in a leisurely exploration of his
preserves than skim the surface in a manner hasty and in-<i>Compleat</i>.</p>

<p>Whatever the demerits of my volume, written at intervals between
war-work and illness, I do trust that of the three counts of the
indictment brought against Nicander’s <i>Theriaca</i>, “longa, incondita,
et nullius farrago fidei,” the verdict of my readers will, at any
rate as regards the last, be “Not Guilty,” for on this head I have
stoutly striven to avoid conviction.</p>

<p>Reference to aid from any book or person is usually set forth in my
pages; but here and at once I acknowledge with glad gratitude the debt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
I owe for counsel and help to certain of my friends, whose names
I yet hesitate to state, “pour ne point leur donner une part de
responsabilité dans les fautes que je suis seul coupable d’avoir
laissé subsister.”</p>

<p>They are: Mr. A. B. Cook, Reader in Classical Archæology at
Cambridge; Dr. Bernard Grenfell, Professor of Papyrology at Oxford;
Dr. A. R. S. Kennedy, Professor of Hebrew and Semitic Languages at
Edinburgh; the late, alas! Dr. Leonard W. King, of the Assyrian
Department of the British Museum; Dr. S. Langdon, Professor of
Assyriology at Oxford; Dr. J. W. Mackail; Dr. A. Shewan; and last,
but very far from least, Mr. H. T. Sheringham.</p>

<p>“<i>And first for the Antiquity of</i> Angling, <i>I shall not say much; but
onely this: Some say, it is as ancient as</i> Deucalion’s <i>Floud: and
others (which I like better) say that</i> Belus <i>(who was the inventer
of godly and vertuous Recreations) was the Inventer of it: and some
others say (for former times have had their Disquisitions about it)
that</i> Seth, <i>one of the sons of</i> Adam, <i>taught it to his sons, and
that by them it was derived to Posterity. Others say, that he left
it engraven on those Pillars, which hee erected to preserve the
knowledge of</i> Mathematicks, Musick, <i>and the rest of those precious
Arts, which by God’s appointment or allowance, and his noble industry
were thereby preserved from perishing in Noah’s Floud</i>.”—<span class="smcap">Isaak

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The craft of Fishing possesses an ancestry so ancient, or according
to a Polynesian legend so literally abysmal, that for those who have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
their business on the waters, deep or shallow, it is but seemly, it
is certainly of interest, to essay the tracing of its pedigree, and
the linking of the generations of its far-flung lineage.</p>

<p>What were, and whence came its first forbears, and of what manner and
of what matter were the original parents of its devices are questions
which should appeal to the large majority of its followers. The
<i>sansculottes</i>, however stalwart, who does not in his heart of hearts
rejoice in owning, or claiming, some genealogical garments, wherein
to hide his nakedness, is rare and abnormal.</p>

<p>The pedigree is like and unlike its celebrated Urquhart brother.
Like in the gaps in generations, which in his endeavour directly to
deduce his family from Adam even Sir Thomas’s ingenuity failed to
bridge, despite the prolongation when necessary of the lives of his
ancestors to ten times the allotted span. Unlike in antiquity, since
it stretches far, very far beyond “Deucalion’s Floud” and Adam’s
Paradise.</p>

<p>Angling, despite wide ramifications, has perhaps stamped its stock
more vividly and has bred truer to original type than its elder
brother Hunting. The variance of a repeating rifle from what some
hold to be their common first sire, a sharpened pole, is larger and
more marked than that of our most up-to-date Rod.</p>

<p>The riddle, as in other cases of disputed succession, of identifying
the first real head of the family or the earliest begetter of the
race is rendered more complex by wide geographical dispersion. It is
possibly insoluble.</p>

<p>Nevertheless to this labour of love I now address myself.</p>

<p>The question of priority of the implement used for catching fish has
been often moot, sometimes acute, for, in Walton’s words, “former
times have had their Disquisitions about it.”</p>

<p>How did the earliest fisherman secure his prey? Was it by means of
the Spear, under which term I include harpoons and barbed fishing
spears of any kind, the Net, or the Line? None of these has lacked
its champions, of whom the Line has attracted the fewest, the Spear the most.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Uncertainty as to the order of precedence was not really remarkable.
We lacked even as late as the beginning of the last century both
the data as to Egyptian and Assyrian fishing, which the discovery
of the key to the hieroglyphs by Champollion and to the cuneiform
by Rawlinson has laid bare, and the data as to the fishing of the
Troglodytes which scientific examination of the caves of France and
Spain has revealed.</p>

<p>The outlook of our forefathers was necessarily limited, indeed
monotopical. No big maps of the archæological world widened their
vision. Some sectional sketches, and these badly charted, obscured
their perspective.</p>

<p>The priority of the Net at one time probably enrolled the majority
of adherents. Nor can we wonder, when we realise that in the case
of a country so ancient as India we light on no method of fishing
other than Netting—and even that till the post-Vedic literature
after 200 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> most rarely—in Sanskrit or Pāli literature
before 400 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Hence came the deduction, not unnatural but illogical, since it
stresses too strongly the argument of silence or omission—<i>i.e.</i>
because no specimen or representation of a thing exists the thing
itself never existed—that the Net must have been the first implement.</p>

<p>And even now after many years of exploration in Mesopotamia a
champion of the Net or of the Line, if he similarly disregarded logic
and all save Assyrian remains, might not unreasonably proclaim their
antecedence to the Spear, of which no mention or representation as a
method of fishing has yet been unearthed.</p>

<p>In the case of Egypt the advocate either of the Spear or Net has
not as strong, certainly not so clear, a case. Although examples of
the first have been discovered in prehistoric graves, the Net finds
representation earlier than the Spear. Be this how it may, the Spear,
Net, Line, Rod flourish synchronously in the XIIth Dynasty <i>c.</i> 2000,
or according to Petrie’s chronology about 3500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>In China, unless the sentence of the quite modern <i>I shih chi shih</i>,
that in the reign of the legendary Emperor who first taught the use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
of fire, “fishermen used the silk of the cocoons for their lines,
a piece of sharpened iron for their hooks, thorn-sticks for their
rods, and split grain for their bait,” be potent enough to produce a
protagonist for the priority of the Rod, the boldest advocate would
shrink from championing either the Spear or Net. The first mention
<i>c.</i> 900 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> (I know of none actually written before this
date<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>),
shows them, and the Rod, in general and simultaneous operation.</p>

<p>From Crete shines out no guiding light. The <i>débris</i> recovered from
centres of the ‘Minoan’ civilisation yields frequent and in the main
vivid pictures of fish, <i>e.g.</i> those on the Phaistos Disc (which is
considered the earliest instance of printing in Europe at any rate)
and the flying fish on glazed pottery from Knossos. But unfortunately
neither in the Annual Reports of Sir Arthur Evans to the British
School at Athens nor (he tells me) in his forthcoming book do <i>modi
piscandi</i> obtain notice.</p>

<p>In Greece, a champion of any single method would be sadly to seek.
The Spear, the Net, the Line, and the Rod all occur in our earliest
authority, Homer, and, curious to note, as a rule in similes. From
the fact that the Spear finds mention but once, the Net twice, and
the Line (with or without the Rod) thrice, a real enthusiast has
deduced an argument for the priority of the last two over the Spear!</p>

<p>This short survey forces the conclusion that we cannot fix definitely
which was the method adopted by the earliest historical fishermen.</p>

<p>Before proceeding on our search for further data two points should be
emphasised. First, the period covered even by the longest historical
or semi-historical record counts but as a fraction of the time since
geology and archæology prove Man to have existed on earth.</p>

<p>Grant, if you will, the demand of the most exacting Egyptologists or
Sumerologists, to whom a thousand years are as nothing; concede their
postulated five or six thousand years; of what account is one lustrum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of millenniums when compared with the years—not less than two
million according to some geologists<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
—which have elapsed since Man first came on the scene?</p>

<p>Second, all the above nations possessed an advanced civilisation.
Neither civilisation nor fishing is a Jovelike creation, springing
into existence armed <i>cap-à-pie</i>. Both, like our friend Topsy,
“growed,” and both demanded long periods for growth and development
from their primitive origin.</p>

<p>In fishing these were retarded by the innate conservatism of the
followers of the cult. The psychology of the faithful is an odd blend
of dogged, perhaps unconscious, adherence to the olden ways and of an
almost Athenian curiosity about “any new thing,” which as often as
not sees itself discarded in favour of the ancient devices.</p>

<p>Even in this year of our Lord a cousin of mine, who Ulysses-like many
rivers has known, much tackle tested, habitually (influenced no doubt
by the recipe for the line given by Plutarch and passed on by Dame
Juliana Berners) inserts between his line and his gut some eighteen
inches of horse hair! But even in him the law of development works,
for he does not Pharisaically adhere to the strict letter of the
text, and insist that the hair comes only from the tail of a stallion
or gelding!<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Then, again, not less than two thousand odd years were needed for the
Rod and the Line of Ælian’s Macedonian angler to take unto themselves
a cubit or so more of length than their Egyptian predecessors.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
The latter may, however, have been rendered shorter than actually
used from the regard paid to artistic convention by the craftsman of Beni-Hasan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>But the connection of the line to the rod furnishes the most
arresting instance of conservatism or slow development. Progress
from the Egyptian method, which made fast the line to the top of the
rod,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
to a “running line” took, so far as discoverable records show, no less
a period than that between <i>c.</i> 2000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
and our sixteenth or seventeenth century, <i>i.e.</i> some 3600, or
(according to Petrie) over 5000, years!</p>

<p>The Reel, which, however rude, would appear a much more complicated
device than other conceivable methods of a running line, seems yet
to be mentioned first. The earliest description occurs in <i>The
Art of Angling</i>, by T. Barker, 1651, the first propagator of the
heresy of the salmon roe, and according to Dr. Turrell “the father
of poachers.” The earliest picture figures in his enlarged edition
of 1657. The Reel affords another instance of slow growth. Its
employment except with salmon or big pike only coincides with the
beginning of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The development to the more subtle method of play by means of spare
line can only be conjectured.</p>

<p>It was obviously invented somewhere between 1496 (<i>The Boke of St.
Albans</i>, where we are expressly told to “dubbe the lyne and frette it
fast in ẏ toppe with a bowe to fasten on your lyne”) and 1651, when
Barker mentions the “wind” (which was set in a hole two feet or so
from the bottom of the rod) as a device employed by a namesake of his
own, and presumably by few beside at that time.</p>

<p>Walton four years later, but anticipating Barker by two as to its
employment in <i>salmon</i> fishing, writes of the “wheele” about the
middle of the rod or nearer the hand as evidently an uncommon device,
“which is to be observed better by seeing one of them than by a large
demonstration of words.”</p>

<p>Focussing a perplexed eye on the picture vouchsafed by Barker in his
enlarged edition of 1657, we are impressed by the wisdom of Father
Izaak. Frankly it is not easy to discern from it what Barker’s “wind”
was intended to be or what the method of working. Apparently he had
in mind two distinct implements, a “wheele” similar to Walton’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
(such perhaps as is figured in the title page of <i>The Experienced Angler</i>
by their contemporary Venables) and a crude winder, such as survives
to-day in our sea-fishing, but intended as an attachment to a Rod.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>This marks a logical and likely step in evolution. It is
inconceivable that invention should have soared to a Reel without
there having been some intermediate stage between it and the “tight”
line. The advantage of extra line for emergencies must have been
recognised pretty early, and a wire ring at the top of the Rod,
through which the line could run, naturally resulted from such recognition.</p>

<p>The method of disposing of the “spare” line may be presumed from
survival of primitive practice. Not many years ago pike fishers in
rustic parts of England often dispensed with a reel. They either let
their spare with a cork at its end trail behind on the ground, or
wound it on a bobbin or a piece of wood, stowed away in a pocket.
Nicholas explains Walton’s (chap. v.) “running line, that is to say,
when you fish for a trout by hand at the ground” as “a line, so called,
because it runs along the ground.”</p>

<p>It seems impossible to fix with certainty the period at which
fishing with a running line made its first appearance. No early data
exist, nor do the few early pictures of mediæval rods indicate the
presence of a wire top ring. I had a lively hope, when I recalled its
many plates and figures, of extracting some guidance from the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
important French work of early date (1660) dealing with fishing, <i>Les
Ruses Innocentes</i>, which may be described (<i>mutatis mutandis</i>) as the
counterpart of <i>The Boke of St. Albans</i>.</p>

<p>The first four books are concerned with “divers methods” (of most of
which the author, <i>à la</i> Barker, claims the invention) for the making
and the using of all kinds of nets for the capture of birds, both of
passage and indigenous, and of many kinds of animals.</p>

<p>The fifth confides to us “les plus beaux secrets de la pêche dans
les Rivières ou dans les Etangs.” As the secrets are concerned
almost entirely with Net fishing, little light reaches us. Both
the instructions and illustrations in chap. xxvi., <i>Invention pour
prendre les Brochets à la ligne volante</i>, show that the line after
being attached about the middle of the pole was twisted round and
round till made fast at the end of the pole, from which depended some
eighteen feet of line.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Setting conjecture aside and faced by the fact that the Egyptian line
was certainly made fast at the top and that neither illustrations nor
writings (so far as I have been able to discover) indicate any other
condition, we are driven by a mass of evidence, negative though it
be, to the conclusion that the ancients<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
and the moderns down to some date between 1496 and 1651 fished with “tight” lines.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
These were either fastened to the Rod whip-fashion, or possibly
looped to it. The distinction is only important in so far as a
horse-hair loop at the end of the Rod may have developed into a top
ring of wire, which must not be confused with rings fixed <i>along</i> the
Rod, which R. Howlett, in <i>The Angler’s Sure Guide</i>, 1706, seems the
first to note.</p>

<p>Why the Greeks or Romans should not have emancipated themselves from
the <i>tight</i> line of Egypt and evolved the <i>running</i> line by the mere
force of their inventive genius causes much astonishment. This grows
acute when we remember that they knew a fish whose properties and
predatory endowments furnished an ideal example of the advantages of
the <i>running</i> line.</p>

<p>Of the angler fish and its methods of securing food Aristotle,
Plutarch, and Ælian are eloquent.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
From Plutarch we learn that “the cuttle fish useth likewise the same
craft as the fishing-frog doth. His manner is to hang down, as if it
were an angle line, a certain small string or gut from about his neck,
which is of that nature that he can let out in length a great way,
when it is loose, and draw it in close together very quickly when he
listeth. Now when he perceiveth some small fish near unto him,” he
forthwith plies his nature-given tackle.</p>

<p>With the <i>tight</i> line play can only be given to a fish by craft
of hand and rod. Anglers know to their sorrow that although much may
be thus accomplished, occasions too frequently arise when the most
expert handling can avail naught.</p>

<p>In Walton’s time the custom, as indeed it was the only present help,
in the event of a big fish being hooked was to throw the Rod into the
water and await its retrieval, if the deities of fishing so willed,
till such time as the fish by pulling it all over the water had
played himself out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
But the existence of some method of releasing line rather earlier
than Barker and Walton may perhaps be inferred from the following
passage in William Browne’s <i>Britannia’s Pastorals</i> (Fifth Song),
published 1613-16:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“He, knowing it a fish of stubborn sway,</span>
<span class="i4">Puls up his rod, but soft: (as having skill)</span>
<span class="i4">Wherewith the hooke fast holds the fishe’s gill.</span>
<span class="i4">Then all his line he freely yeeldeth him,</span>
<span class="i4">Whilst furiously all up and downe doth swimme</span>
<span class="i4">Th’ insnared fish....</span>
<span class="i4">By this the pike, cleane wearied, underneath</span>
<span class="i4">A willow lyes and pants (if fishes breathe):</span>
<span class="i4">Wherewith the fisher gently puls him to him,</span>
<span class="i4">And, least his haste might happen to undo him,</span>
<span class="i4">Lays down his rod, then takes his line in hand,</span>
<span class="i4">And by degrees getting the fish to land,</span>
<span class="i4">Walkes to another poole.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A few years suffice to span the interval between William Browne and
Barker, whereas between Theocritus and Barker a great gulf of time
yawns unbridged. Thus we have renderings of the former (Idyll XXI.)
and of other classical authors by translators (more especially when
they happen to be also anglers!) which demonstrate ignorance or
ignoring of the fixity of line and the absence of reel.</p>

<p>These, if not palpably anachronous, afford at any rate evidence of
incuriosity concerning facts. Their “then I gave him slack” and other
similar expressions, true enough of our present line, can be no way
applicable to the conditions of ancient Angling, unless the words
mean—and then only by strained construing—that their “slack” was
given by depression of Rod rather than by lengthening of line.</p>

<p>With the hook also we are confronted with a similar slowness of
development. This is so well attested that we need more than even
the authority of Butcher and Lang to establish what their slip in
translating γναμπτὰ ἂγκιστρα as <i>bent hooks</i> in <i>Odyssey</i> IV., 369,
and as <i>barbed hooks</i> in <i>Odyssey</i> XII., 332, would suggest, viz. a
synonymous form of a synchronous invention.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Since it is impossible to fix the length of time, if any, which
separates the New Stone from the Copper Age, we can make no adequate
guess as to how many generations of men and how many centuries of
time were needed to transform the bent into the barbed hook. Perhaps
Æneolithic experts can.</p>

<p>Extant examples from Egypt of both furnish, however, some
chronological data. If the argument from silence, or rather from
non-survival in one particular country, be not pressed unduly, these
tend to prove that so far from their being twin brethren, the birth
of the bent anteceded that of the barbed hook by at any rate the
number of years which separated the Ist from the XVIIIth Dynasty,
before which the occurrence of a barbed hook is rare.</p>

<p>The first implement of fishing, be it what you please, was no
split-cane Rod, nor the “town-like Net” of Oppian, but some simple
device created by the insistent necessity of procuring food. With our
primitive ancestors, as with the companions of Menelaus, often “was
hunger gnawing at their bellies,” a hunger accentuated at one period
by the retreat further into the primeval forests or at another by
the actual decrease of the animals, which had hitherto furnished the
staple of Man’s sustenance.</p>

<p>Fortunately other data more ancient and more authoritative than the
Egyptian or Sumerian as to priority of implement help the quest of
Archæologists.</p>

<p>Blazing their trail backwards in the half-light of non-historical
forests, they hap on many a <i>cache</i> of ancient devices in the
settlements of the New Stone Man. Pausing merely to examine these, they
cut their way through yet denser and darker timber, until eventually
they emerge at an opening wherein once stood the ultimate if scarcely
the original storehouse, whence Neolithic Man drew and in the course of
long travel bettered his materials—the dwelling place of the Old Stone Man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>To this storehouse we too must press, tarrying only at the <i>caches</i> to
note cursorily Neolithic betterment or invention. The dwelling place is
one of many mansions, or rather of many rude caverns dotted over Europe.</p>

<p>Of such are Kent’s Cave near Torquay (which from its remains of
animals may have been a mansion, or technically a “station,” as early
as any), the Kesserloch in Switzerland, the shelters, or <i>cavernes</i>,
in Southern France, of which La Madelaine in Dordogne, earliest to
be discovered, ranks still the most famous, and a score or so of
stations in Spain—not limited we now realise to its north-west
corner—of which Altamira, not far from Santander, stands out pre-eminent.</p>

<p>With their exploration a remoter vista has opened out in recent
years; a wholly new standpoint has been gained from which to review
the early history of the human race. A brilliant band of prehistoric
archæologists has brought together such a mass of striking materials
as to place the evolution of human art and appliances in the
Quaternary Period on a level far higher than had been previously
ever suspected. The investigations of Lartet, Cartailhac, Piette,
Breuil, Obermaier, etc., have revolutionised our knowledge of a phase
of human culture which goes so far back beyond the limits of any
continuous story that it may well be said to belong to an older world.</p>

<p>These sentences of Sir Arthur Evans<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
gain further emphasis from Professor Boyd-Dawkins: “It is not too much
to state that the frescoed caves in Southern France and Northern Spain
throw as much light on the life of those times as the Egyptian tombs do
on the daily life of Egypt, or the walls of the Minoan palace on the
luxury of Crete, before the Achæan conquest.”</p>

<p>The picture of Palæolithic life revealed by these dwelling places
attracts from every point of view. But as our last is fish and
fishing, to fish and fishing we must stick. I shall therefore limit
myself to the caves which furnish specimens or representations of
ichthyic interest, with the one exception of “marvellous Altamira,”
which, though it unfortunately yields us no portrayals of fishing,
from every other aspect compels mention.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>So astonishing was the discovery of this cave with its whole
galleries of <i>painted</i> designs on the walls and ceilings that it
required a quarter of a century and the corroboration of repeated
finds on the French side of the Pyrenees for general recognition that
these rock paintings were of the Palæolithic age, and that features,
which had been hitherto reckoned as exclusively belonging to the New
Stone Man, can now be classed as the original property of the Man of
the Old Stone Age in the final production of his evolution.</p>

<p>These primeval frescoes in their most developed state (Evans,
<i>ibid.</i>, tells us) show not only a consummate mastery of natural
design, but also an extraordinary technical resource. Apart from the
charcoal used in certain outlines, the chief colouring matter was
red and yellow ochre, mortars and palettes for the preparation of
which have come to light. In single animals the tints are varied from
black to dark and ruddy brown or brilliant orange, and so by fine
gradations to paler <i>nuances</i>, obtained by scraping and washing.</p>

<p>The greatest marvel is that such polychrome masterpieces as the
bisons standing and couchant or with limbs huddled together
were executed on the ceilings of inner vaults and galleries,
where the light of day never penetrated. Nowhere does smoke blur
their outlines, probably (as Parkyn<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
suggests) because of long oxidisation. The art of artificial
illumination had evidently progressed far. We now, indeed, know that
stone lamps, decorated in one case with the head of an ibex, already
existed.</p>

<p>“<i>Les extremes se touchent</i>” was here aptly exemplified, for
to a very young child was it reserved to discover the very oldest
art gallery in the world. In 1879 Señor de Santuola chanced to be
digging in a cave on his property, when he heard his little daughter
cry, “Toros, toros!” Realising quickly that this was no warning of
an impending charge by bulls, he followed her gaze to the vaulted
ceiling, where his eyes there espied “the finest expression of
Palæolithic art extant.”</p>

<p>This little Spanish girl was the first for many, many thousands of
years to behold a collection of pictures, which demonstrate not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the high point of excellence to which the art of the Troglodytes had
attained, but also, from the absence of perspective and of decorative
as compared with pictorial composition, indicate how long is probably
the interval and how far is the separation between them and the Men
of the Neolithic Age.</p>

<p>Not only in the character of their Art, which if more specialised
in subjects was superior in representative quality, but also in the
substance and in the method of fashioning their fishing and hunting
implements, the separation between the Old Stone and the New Stone
Man is very marked.</p>

<p>The former for their stone implements almost always used flint. They
worked it to shape merely by flaking or chipping. The latter employed
also diorite, quartzite, etc., and in addition to flaking fashioned
them by grinding and polishing.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>It must, I fear, be acknowledged that the <i>caches</i> of the New Stone
Age fail to give us the help expected towards settling what was the
first implement employed. It is true that they yield hooks, nets,
net-sinkers, which may have been merely developments of Troglodyte
tackle, but, judging from the absence of any surviving Palæolithic
example, were more probably new inventions.</p>

<p>But neither these nor the implements of succeeding Ages furnish us
with evidence sufficient to decide the tackle first employed by the
earliest fisherman, or even by the Old Stone Man, for, as Cartailhac
truly warns us, “Ce n’est pas, comme on l’a dit à tort, le début de
l’art que nous découvrons. L’art de l’âge du renne est beaucoup trop
ancien.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>And here it may well be objected, if the New Stone Age does not
disclose any priority of implement, why further pursue what thus must
be the insoluble? Why, indeed, especially if it be true that their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
tackle with some additional devices merely shows up as a development
and improvement of that of their predecessors, to whom in point of
time they surely stand nearer than any other known race?</p>

<p>The objection is pertinent. But, startling as the statement may seem,
there now exist, or have within the last century existed, races, who
<i>in the actual material, and in the mode of fashioning, of their
weapons</i> are, in the opinion of experts, nearer akin to and resemble
more closely Palæolithic than did Neolithic man.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Eskimos, Cartailhac simply summarises the evidence of
many authorities, when he writes “the likenesses in the above points
are so striking that one sees in them the true descendants of the
Troglodytes of Perigord.”</p>

<p>Professor Boyd-Dawkins goes farther. He finds the Eskimos so
intimately connected with the Cave Men in their manners and customs,
in their art, especially in their method of representing animals, and
in their implements and weapons, that “the only possible explanation
is that they belong to the same race: that they are representatives
of the Troglodytes, protected within the Arctic circle from those
causes by which their forbears had been driven from Europe and Asia.
They stand at the present day wholly apart from other living races,
and are cut off from all by the philologer and the craniologist.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Food supply probably effected the migration of the Eskimos, or rather
of their ancestors from Europe.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
At the close of the last ice age, as the ice cap retreated Northwards,
the reindeer followed the ice, and the Eskimo followed the reindeer.</p>

<p>Of the aborigines of Tasmania Professor E. B. Tylor testifies: “If
there have remained anywhere up to modern times men, whose condition
has changed little since the early Stone Age, the Tasmanians seem
such a people. Many tribes of the late Stone Age have lasted on into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
modern times, but it appears that the Tasmanians by the workmanship
of their stone implements represent rather the condition of
Palæolithic man.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Sollas goes even farther: “The Tasmanians, however, though recent
were at the same time a Palæolithic or even, it has been suggested,
an Eolithic race: they thus afford us an opportunity of interpreting
the past by the present—a saving procedure in a subject where
fantasy is only too likely to play a leading part.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
But their usual technique is against Eolithicism.</p>

<p>If these authoritative statements be accurate, can we not hazard
a shrewd conjecture from examination of the implements and of the
methods prevalent amongst the backward or uncivilised tribes closely
resembling our Cave Dwellers, as to which was probably the first
implement or method employed for catching fish? Can we, in fact, from
the data available from the Eskimos, Tasmanians, and other similar
races so reconstruct our men of Dordogne and elsewhere as to adjudge
approximately whether first in their hands at any rate was the Spear,
the Hook, or the Net?</p>

<p>Such a quest seems one of the incidental motives of G. de Mortillet
in <i>Les Origines de la Chasse et de la Pêche</i>, 1890, which modifies
in several particulars his earlier <i>Les Origines de la Pêche et de
la Navigation</i>, 1867. We find from his pages and those of Rau’s
<i>Prehistoric Fishing</i> (1884), and of Parkyn’s <i>Prehistoric Art</i>
(1916), that a comparative examination of the above races, as it
ramifies, discloses not only a close resemblance to Palæolithic Man
in the material, nature, and fashioning of their tackle, but also in
their art and method of expressing their art.</p>

<p>Such similarity of art, evident in the Eskimos, stands revealed by
the Bushmen of Africa (especially in the caves formerly used for
habitations by the tribes of the Madobo range) in no less obvious
or striking degree. “The nearest parallels to the finer class of
rock carvings in the Dordogne are in fact to be found among the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
ancient specimens of similar work in South Africa, while the rock
paintings of Spain find their best analogies among the Bushmen.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The Africans, it is true, perfected their engravings on the surface
of the rocks more frequently by “pecking.” But both they and
Palæolithic man make free and successful use of colours, of which the
African possesses six as against the three or four of his European
brethren. Each race depicts fish and animals so life-like as to be
easily identifiable.</p>

<p>What evidence as to priority do the Eskimo methods of to-day yield
us? Cartailhac but echoes Rau, Salomon Reinach, and Hoffmann<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
in his assertion that the prehistoric Reindeer Age compares practically
with the actual age of the Eskimos. Their fishing spears in material,
shape, and barb resemble the Palæolithic.</p>

<p>Their carvings and engravings of fishing and whaling scenes on bone
and ivory show clear kinship to the Dordognese.</p>

<p>Hoffmann’s able study of the Eskimos not only brings out these
similarities, but also specially notes the closeness with which
they observe and the exactitude with which they render anatomical
peculiarities of fish and animals. As portrayers of the human form,
on the other hand, they must be reckoned far from expert. The caves
of France and those of Spain in general, although the <i>paintings</i> of
the human form at Calapata and other places are far more finished and
far more frequent than the French drawings, disclose curiously the
same power and the same deficiency as characteristic of Troglodyte
art.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>No race probably in the world depends so greatly on fishing for a
livelihood as the Eskimos. From them, if from any, we should derive
most light and leading. With them the Spear and the Hook form the
chief, and till recently probably the only, tackle. Nets, on account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
of the ice, play little part. To any claim for precedence of the
former over the latter, a champion of the Net demurs on the ground
of climatic conditions, which he not unreasonably urges prevent any
proper analogy in this respect being drawn between them and our Cave Men.</p>

<p>Touching the similarity of the Tasmanian to the Troglodyte, Ling
Roth amplifies, especially as regards the material, etc. of the
Spear, the evidence contained in Tylor’s already quoted sentence.
This in conjunction with Captain Cook’s earlier statement that the
Tasmanians, while experts with the Spear, were ignorant of the use of
a Hook, and, according to Wentworth, of a Net, would have gone far in
helping our quest and in establishing the precedence of the Spear.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the evidence of Lloyd and others that these aborigines
speared fish as a pastime, coupled with the fact that while they
consumed <i>crustaceæ</i> they abstained (probably from reasons of tabu or
totem) from eating scaled fish, sharply differentiates their <i>Kultur</i>
from that of our prehistoric fishermen “at whose bellies hunger was
gnawing.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>From Mexico, and especially from the representations in Yucatan,
I had hoped for new factors helping to solve our problem. First,
because these had so far escaped the meticulous examination of the
Madelainian, and second, because they were the product of an ancient
people, the Mayas, who ranked fish as an important item of their
diet, and pursued fishing with the Spear and the Net.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>With the Aztecs, who in the thirteenth century inherited the
Maya culture, now dated as regards their architecture back to
the first three centuries <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
the hook arrives, or rather appears. Aztec skill in fishing stands well
attested. Their artificial fishponds or <i>vivaria</i>, and the importance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
which they attached to fish as a food extract favourable comment from
Cortez.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>In spite of the pictographs, known as the Mendoza Codex,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
being executed several centuries after the date I have roughly allotted
myself, <i>viz.</i> 500 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, I cannot resist
inserting two of these on account of their fourfold interest.</p>

<p>They show first, that Mexican lads received early in their teens
education in fishing. Second, that the Aztecs were familiar with
scoop nets. Third—and this surely will go to the heart of our Food
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Controller—that food was rationed. From the circles or dots we
learn that the age of one youth depicted was thirteen, and from the
two connected ovals marked with small dashes that his allowance of
food consisted of two cakes or <i>tortillas</i> a meal. Fourth, by the
symbol before his mouth, that the father is speaking. The symbol very
roughly reminds us of the Assyrian system of signs which determine
the nature or subject of a word, as the two hundred odd fish
mentioned in Asur-bani-pal’s library at Nineveh signify.</p>

<p>But Mexico as a staff in our quest of priority breaks in our hands.
The Museo Nacional a few years ago contained nothing of prehistoric
fishing interest except perhaps a notched stone sinker. Greater
disappointment still, the wealth of ancient Maya information from
the monuments of Merida yields us sometimes fish, but never fishing
scenes.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
From ancient Peru I had hoped help, but neither the four massive
tomes of <i>Ancient Peruvian Art</i> by A. Baessler, nor <i>The Fish in
Peruvian Art</i> by Charles W. Mead vouchsafe it.</p>

<p>To the absence among the ancient Peruvians of any written language
Mead attributes the very early arrival of conventionalism in art.
In consequence of conventionalism, fish at the period reached are
merely rendered as various designs, notably that of the “interlocked
fishes,” <i>i.e.</i> a pattern of parts of two fish turned in opposite
directions, a curious example of which may be found in Mead, Plate I.
fig. 9. The mythological monster, part fish part man, in Plate II.
fig. 13, compares and contrasts with similar Assyrian representations.</p>

<p>The tomes of <i>The Necropolis of Ancon</i> fail also to aid us. Among
the hundreds of objects of Inca civilization depicted, nothing
piscatorial, except some copper fishing hooks and a few spears, comes
to view.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Joyce, however, gives a fishing scene depicted on a pot from
the Truxillo district of the coast, which the author dates
pre-Inca, or anywhere between 200 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> and
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span><a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>From his book emerge two interesting points of comparative
mythology. The first—which compares with Assyrian and other similar
legends<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
—the tradition that culture was first brought to Ecuador
by men of great stature coming from the sea, who lived by fishing
with nets; the second—which compares with the Egyptian practice—the
custom among certain primitive coast tribes of placing provisions,
among which were fish, in the graves of the dead.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Other races of the world present many points of similarity to the
French cave men. The Bushmen of Africa, and the Bushmen of Australia,
<i>inter alios</i>, exemplify this. Banfield, in dealing with the drawings
or so-called frescoes of men, animals, and fish on Dunk Island,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
vouches for the latter as “of talent, original and academic. Here is
the sheer beginning, the spontaneous germ of art, the labourings of a
savage soul controlled by wilful æsthetic emotions.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>This review of the fishing weapons and methods of the races
cited—especially of the Eskimos and the Tasmanians, the races
closest to the Troglodytes—provides data which make for a plausible
conjecture, but none, owing to differing conditions caused by climate
or custom, which enable a definite decision as to priority of implement.</p>

<p>Let us return from this survey of races to the <i>cavernes</i> and examine
their contents.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Their <i>débris</i>
(at times ten feet deep and seventy long) manifests that these
<i>stations</i> served as habitations for several generations of men.</p>

<p>From nearly all the French stations neighbouring the sea or rivers,
bones of fish, especially of salmon, have been recovered. These have
been identified, but not without some dissent, as belonging to the
Tunny, <i>Labrax lupus</i>, Eel, Carp, Barbel, Trout, and <i>Esox lucius</i>.</p>

<p>The presence of the last, our pike, in this (and again in Neolithic)
<i>débris</i> excites our interest as evidence that the Troglodytes knew
and made use of a fish whose absence, despite its wide geographical
distribution, from all Greek and Latin literature until we reach the
time of Ausonius, Cuvier, or more strictly Valenciennes, notes with
extreme surprise.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>While in La Madelaine and elsewhere fish occur abundantly in the
<i>débris</i>, at some <i>cavernes</i> in the Vézère Valley, notably Le
Moustier, they cannot be traced. Their absence coupled with the
presence of animal bones has led some archæologists to the conclusion
that Le Moustier and other stations were earlier inhabited than La
Madelaine, at a time, in fact, when according to Paul Broca, “Man
hunted the smaller animals as well as large game, but had not yet
learned how to reach the fish.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to osseous deposits, numerous ichthyic carvings and
engravings on materials and weapons present themselves. It is
curious, however, to note that (at any rate up to 1915) of all the
caves and grottoes two only, Pindal on the wall, and Niaux (the
latest discovered French cave where black is the solitary colour
employed) on the floor, furnish us with representations of fish on
<i>wall or floor</i>.</p>

<p>Such is their graphic truthfulness and attention to detail that,
according to the former writer, the trout which the seals have
killed floats, as dead fish do, belly up, and is not only perfectly
characterised in general form, but is rendered with the spots on the
top of the back dotted quite accurately.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>

<p>The frequent engravings of animals and of fish prompt S. Reinach and
others to the interesting surmise that since all or most portray
creatures desired for food by hunters and fishermen, they were
executed not for amusement, “mais sont les talismans de chasseurs
qui craignent de manquer de gibier. L’objet des artistes a été
d’exercer une attraction magique sur les animaux de la même espèce.
Les indigènes de l’Australie Centrale peignent aussi sur les roches

After pointing out that the representations of the Reindeer epoch
“offrent un caractère analogue,” he continues, “À cette phase très
ancienne d’evolution humaine la religion (au sens moderne de ce mot)
n’existe pas encore, mais la magie joue un rôle considerable et
s’associe à toutes les formes de l’activité.”<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Magic, especially imitative magic, according to Frazer and others,
plays a great part in the measures taken by the rude hunter or
fisherman to secure an abundant supply of food. On the principle that
like produces like, many things are done by him or for him by his
friends in deliberate imitation of the result sought.</p>

<p>Confirmatory evidence from races, past and present the world over,
stands ready to call. The Point Barrow Eskimos, when following the
whale, always carry a whale-shaped amulet of stone or wood. The North
African fisherman of the present day, in obedience to an ancient
Moslem work on Magic, fashions a tin image of the fish which he desires,
inscribes it with four mystic letters, and fastens it to his line.</p>

<p>If at the due season fish fail to appear, the Nootka wizard
constructs of wood<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
a fish swimming, and launches it in the direction whence the schools
generally arrive. This simulacrum, plus incantations, compels the
laggards in no time.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>In Cambodia, if a netsman be unsuccessful, he strips naked and
withdraws a short distance: then strolling up to the net, as if he
saw it not, he lets himself be caught in the meshes, whereupon he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
calls out, “What is this? I fear I am caught.” Such procedure is
believed to attract the fish efficaciously and to ensure a good
haul.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Scotland not a century ago witnessed pantomimes of similar character,
according to the Rev. J. Macdonald, minister of Reay. Fishermen,
when dogged by ill luck, threw one of their number overboard and
then hauled him out of the water, exactly as if he were a fish. This
Jonah-like ruse apparently induced appetite, for “soon after trout,
or sillock, would begin to nibble.”</p>

<p>The comparative ethnologist detects in all these cases an attempt
to establish direct relations between the hunter or the fisher and
his quarry. Primitive man in search for food frequently seeks to
establish an impalpable but in his eyes very serviceable connection
between himself and the object of his quest by working a likeness of
his desired prey.</p>

<p>Such a likeness, according to the doctrine that a <i>simulacrum</i> is
actively <i>en rapport</i> with that which it represents, bestows on its
possessor power over the original—“l’auteur ou le possesseur d’une
image peut influencer ce qu’elle représente.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
The cases are simply the commonplaces of homœpathic or imitative
magic.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>We find that just as the savage attempts to appease the ghosts of men
he has slain, so he essays to propitiate the spirits of the animals
and fish he has killed: for this purpose elaborate ceremonies of
propitiation are widely observed.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Of similar character and intent are the taboos observed by fishermen
before the season opens, and the purifications performed on returning
with their booty.</p>

<p>Magic, exercised not so much to propitiate as to avoid offending some
power—in the following instance the element of water—originated the
rule (existent among the Eskimos fifty years ago) that forbade during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the salmon season any water being boiled in a house, because “this is
bad for the fishing.” Frazer suggests that the Commandment in Exodus
xxxiv. 26, “Not to seethe a kid in its mother’s milk,” embodies a
like illustration.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>From carvings, whether executed for purposes of amusement or of
magic, and from specimens found in the <i>débris</i> of the stations, we
derive our knowledge of the earliest implements and methods employed
in Perigord and elsewhere for taking fish.</p>

<p>A study of these warrants, to my mind, the conclusion that only
two weapons can be traceably attributed to Palæolithic Man. First
and pre-eminent the Spear (or Harpoon with its various congeners)
with possibly adjustable flint-heads, and second, but to a far less
extent, the Gorge, or as it has been better termed, “the bait-holder.”</p>

<p>Of a Troglodyte Net no representation exists, no specimen survives.
The absence of an actual specimen can perhaps be explained by the
perishable nature of the fibres or wythes used for its construction.</p>

<p>The undeniable survival of pieces of Nets among the lake dwellers
seems somewhat to negative the explanation.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
But these may have survived because of the presence, while those of
the Palæolithic Age may have perished because of the absence of some
preservative power in the substance in which they were embedded.</p>

<p>The absence from the latter and the presence in the former <i>débris</i>
of Net sinkers, etc., strongly, if not conclusively, corroborate
Broca’s conclusion that the Cave men of the Vézère Valley and
elsewhere were strangers to the Net.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>We possess, in my opinion, no evidence of Hooks (as distinct from
Gorges) or of anything resembling Hooks <i>proper</i>—<i>viz.</i> hooks made
out of one piece, recurved, and with sharpened ends—being used by
the Old Stone Man.</p>

<p>De Mortillet, it is true, writing in 1867,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
states that “hooks belonging to the reindeer epoch have been found in
the Caves of Dordogne. Along with those of the simple form (the gorges)
others were met with of much more perfect shape.” In his later work
(<i>op. cit.</i>) of 1890 he contents himself with claiming the existence of
a hook, but of very primitive type, “a small piece of bone tapered at
either end”—in fact, nothing more than the Gorge.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>S. Reinach, again, instances “three fish-hooks,” but whittles them away
till they become “two sharp points more in the nature of a gorge.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Osborne, commenting on the numerous pigmy flints discovered in the
Tardenoisian <i>débris</i>, writes that “it would appear that a large number
of these were adapted for insertion in small harpoons, or that those
of the grooved form might even have been used as fish-hooks.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
With the opinion of Christy (co-explorer with Lartet of La Madelaine) that
those pointed bone rods or gorges “may have formed part of fish-hooks,
having been tied to other bones or sticks obliquely,”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
the evidence in favour of the Hook practically finishes.</p>

<p>The case, I venture to maintain, breaks down. And this, too, in
spite of the view expressed and the evidence adduced by so eminent
an authority as Abbé H. Breuil, and in spite of the <i>gravure de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Fontarnaud figurant un poisson mordant</i> (?)—the query is
Breuil’s—<i>à l’hameçon</i>. The <i>gravure</i> fails to convince, chiefly
because <i>les hameçons</i> figured do not recurve in the proper sense.
They seem to be more in the nature of <i>gorges</i> curved back and much
improved in the course of generations.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The evolution of the primitive gorge, in particular those with ends
slightly curved, into a double fish-hook was, I suggest, probably an
easy process, more especially with the discovery of the adaptability
of bronze. But these gorges can never be properly termed hooks.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

   <p class="f90">1. From La Madelaine. 2. From La Madelaine, grooved for attaching the
                  line.<br />3 and 4. From Santa Cruz, California. The slight curving of 3
                  may be possibly<br /> the first step towards the more rounded gorge, and
                  eventually the bent hook.</p>
</div>

<p class="space-above2">The function of the hook is to establish a hold by penetration,
that of a gorge by resistance—once down, <i>vestigia nulla retrorsum</i>.
A shape with some but not too great curvature<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
would increase such resistance, one with more would possibly give
the additional safeguard of penetration.</p>

<p>Meditation on this duplication of functions might lead an enquiring
mind to conclude that penetration alone might suffice for what was
required. Thus farther curve might be added for this ostensible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
purpose, with the result that in time the hook supersedes the gorge,
to which it is superior in several respects, not least in ease and
speed of extraction from a fish when landed.</p>

<p>Small bone rods tapering towards both ends, and sometimes grooved in
the middle probably for attachment of a line, form the gorges of the
Caves. Their descendants or kinsmen found all the world over vary
in shape and material. But whether fashioned of bone, or flake of
flint, or of turtle-shell, with cocoa nut used as trimmers, whether
straight or curved at the ends, the purpose and operation of one and
all is the same—to be swallowed (buried in bait) by the fish <i>end
first</i>. The tightening of the line soon alters this position into one
crosswise in the stomach or gullet. Even at the present time in some
parts of England the needle, buried in a worm when “sniggling” for
eels, works successfully in similar fashion.</p>

<p>It is not possible here to discuss fully the various materials
and shapes of the first Hook proper. This (according to my view)
Neolithic, certainly post-Palæolithic,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
creation developed doubtless from the over-education of fish, a
complaint possibly as rife then as in our own day.</p>

<p>No writer, despite zealous endeavours, has succeeded in determining
which material—stone (rarely found), bone, shell, or thorn<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
—was first employed for the purpose. On that which lay readiest would
probably be essayed the prentice hand of each particular race. To
dwellers near the shore the large supply and easy adaptability of
shells would of a surety appeal. These could be fashioned so as to be
used alone, or lashed with fibre to a piece of wood or bone so as to
form the bend, while the wood or bone constituted the shank of the
hook.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Prehistoric Man often with a limited local supply was driven to adopt
and adapt any material which could be forced into his purpose of a
hook. To this cause has been ascribed one of the most extraordinary
hooks on record. This relic, now in the Berlin Museum, of the
lacustrine dwellers is formed out of the upper mandible of an eagle,
notched down to the base.</p>

<p>But the most interesting <i>natural</i> fish-hook known to me (found in
Goodenough Island, New Guinea) is the thick upper joint of the hind
leg of an insect, <i>Eurycantha latro</i>, furnished, however, only by the
male, who is endowed with the long, stout recurved spur, suitable for
fishing. The leg joints and therefore the hooks got from them (about
1⅝ inches long) are supplied ready made by Nature: they merely
require to be fastened to a tapered snood of twisted vegetable matter
for immediate employment.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Where flints, shells, and horn were absent or, if present, were not
turned to account, an abundance of thorns with bend and point ready
made and with proved capacities of piercing and holding would attract
the notice and serve the purpose of the New Stone Man. Such later on
was the case in Babylon and Israel (in both of which countries the
primary sense of the word equalling hook seems, according to some
authorities, to have been thorn<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>),
and is the case even now with our fishermen in Essex and the Mohave
Indians in Arizona.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

The suggestion that the choice of material was generally prompted by
abundance or proximity of supply seems reasonable. But it must not be
pushed as far as the assumption (of which a glance at the evidence
as to material adduced by Joyce detects the absurdity) that, because
gold was very abundant in Columbia and because gold fish-hooks have
been unearthed in Cauca and elsewhere, the primitive angler of that
country employed gold as the chief constituent of his hook!<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Nor, again, is it possible for me to dwell on the evolution or in
some countries the possible <i>pari passu</i> development of the single
into the double hook (mentioned in England first in <i>The Experienc’d
Angler</i> of Venables, 1676), nor yet to trace the various stages by
which the simple bone or tusk hook of Wangen or Moosseedorf blossomed
out into the barbed metal hook of the Copper Age.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
The Spear-Harpoon and some points of reindeer horn alone remain for
consideration. Opinion is divided as to the nature and use of these
points. Some pronounce them mere arrow heads.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Against this view leans the fact that, while they have been recovered
mainly from the French caves, no real proof as yet exists of
Palæolithic Man north of the Pyrenees being acquainted with the bow.
Paintings discovered in 1910 at Alpera in the south-east of Spain
show, however, men carrying and drawing bows, and arrows with barbed
points and feathered shafts, but no quivers. Northern Man, if he did
not paint, may well have employed, arrows, for hunting scenes, in which
they should figure, as at Minatada and Alpera, are wanting in France.</p>

<p>Other writers maintain that these points were the armatures of
hunting spears, others, arguing from their easy detachment, that they
were the heads of fish-spears or harpoons. But this contrivance seems
far too complicated for our primitive <i>piscator</i>. No writer proves
conclusively what was the exact purpose of these points, or whether,
in fact, the fish-spears or harpoons had detachable heads. E. Krause
suggests that as the earliest fish-spears were of wood, they readily
lost or broke their points when striking rocks, etc.; hence came bone
and then flint points.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The Spear-Harpoon stands out as the one fishing weapon whose
existence is undeniable, whose employment is predominant. It is too
world-wide and too well-known to need lengthy description.</p>

<p>Reindeer-horn supplied in general the material of the earlier heads,
stag-horn of the later.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
The heads tapered (like Eskimo and other harpoon heads) to a point and
were barbed (as the two accompanying illustrations indicate) on both
sides. They have sometimes toward the lower end little eminences or
knobs, and sometimes barbs provided with incisions or grooves, which
some surmise held poison.

<p>The Harpoon makes its appearance in the middle or (according to
Osborne) early Magdalenian deposits. Its crudest form shows a short,
straight piece of bone, deeply grooved on one face, the ridges and
notches along one edge being the only indications of what later
developed into the recurved barbed points of the typical Harpoon.
These barbs or points, retroverted in such a manner as to hold their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
place in the flesh of the fish, do not suddenly appear like an
inventive mutation, but very slowly evolve as their usefulness is
demonstrated by practice.</p>

<p>The shaft is very rarely perforated at the base for the attachment
of a line<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>;
it is cylindrical (later flat) in form adapted to the capture of large
fish in streams. The harpoons may possibly have been projected by means
of the so-called <i>propulseurs</i> or dart throwers, which resemble the
Eskimo and Australian implements of to-day.</p>

<p>Amidst the clash of opinion as to the exact use and method of use of
these weapons, my conclusion, admittedly incapable of absolute proof,
holds that the Palæolithic fisher owes to the hunter the inception of
the chief weapon of his equipment, the Spear-Harpoon.</p>

<p>Paul Broca’s dictum<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
that Man hunted before he fished seems, perhaps, despite Dall’s excavation
of Eskimo <i>débris</i>,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
to be borne out by Troglodyte records both positive and negative. The
Gorge or bait-holder was employed by the hunter (according to some)
even earlier than by the fisher. Gorges have been from time immemorial
and still are in vogue in the Untersee for the capture of marine birds,
as is the case to-day with the Eskimos of Norton Sound.</p>

<p>From the chronicles of Rau, H. Philips, and others can be built a
Table of Generations, or the story of how the Hunting Spear begat the
Fishing Spear, which begat the Harpoon unilaterally barbed, which in
turn begat the Harpoon bilaterally barbed, until about the tenth or
twentieth generation—one is appalled at the amount of Succession Duty
which such degrees of descent would now involve!—something begat the Rod.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>From this genealogical table I venture to dissent. I claim that the
hunting Spear, Protean in possibilities, was either itself the Rod,
or was, if “matre pulchra filia pulchrior” do not apply, at least
the direct parent of the primitive Rod. In the bigger hunting of
our own sorrowful day the same principle manifests itself, for the
British soldier in France often angled with his line attached to his
bayoneted rifle.</p>

<p>Many writers have attempted, some like de Mortillet with typical
French logic, some with none, to set down the sequential development
of fishing. As the Censor has not as yet banned free expression of
piscatorial opinions, I conclude this chapter with essaying a scheme
of reconstruction of my own.</p>

<p><i>First</i> came fishing with the hand, <i>la pêche à la main</i>, which,
according to Abel Hovelacque, “<i>est le mode le plus élémentaire et
certainement le moins productif</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
This method we may surmise was first exercised on fish left half
stranded in small pools by the action of tides or floods, or on fish
spawning in the shallow redds.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>As <i>la pêche à la main</i> was the first to arrive, so was it the
first to cease from the functions of parentage or of fission, for with
“tickling,” described by Ælian as even in his day an ancient device,
further evolution of this method practically ended.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
<i>Second</i> came the hunting Spear, used originally on fish lying
in pools, small of size but of depth sufficient to prevent hand
fishing, and then, later, on fish elsewhere in a river. On the
latter, especially in the case of the salmon—in Pliny’s day still
abundant in Aquitania, which comprised the Loire and many Palæolithic
<i>cavernes</i>—the weapon, even if as bident or trident it had added
unto itself a prong or two, would frequently be found ineffective,
owing to lack of prehensility. Hence came about a modification,
perhaps due either to the happy chance of a spear on which a point
or thorn had inadvertently been left, or to the inventive faculty of
some Troglodyte Hardy.</p>

<p>We later reach a Spear Harpoon with barbs on one side only, whence
“line upon line,” or rather barb upon barb, we attain unto the later
type, which had a barbed head so socketed as to come free from the
shaft (when the quarry has been struck) but made fast to the head by
a line for retrieving the fish. In due, if differing, gradation we
ultimately attain either unto the existing device of the aboriginal
Tsuŷ Hwan of Formosa, an arrow shaped like a trident shot from but
attached to a bow, or unto <i>le dernier cri</i>, our whaling Harpoon shot
from a gun.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p><i>Third</i> comes fishing with a line of some sort. This was devised
doubtless by some hungry but perforce merely meditative Magdalenian
observing how dropped morsels were seized by fish in a pool, whose
depth or environment set at naught both his hand and his spear.</p>

<p>The problem how to reach and how to land them was eventually solved
by the method—happily christened by Sheringham, “Entanglement by
Appetite”—of fastening a gorge through or a thorn holding some
kind of bait to an animal sinew, a wythe, or a hardened thong
of one of the whip-like <i>algæ</i>. This wythe or what not in the
procession of the ages was (according to Pepys) to betaper itself
into the first English catgut line of 1667, and (according to <i>The
Compleat Fisherman</i>, London, 1724) into the first silkworm line, and
eventually into telerana and similar tenuities of our day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Entanglement by Appetite,” of which a primitive form exists among
the Fuegians,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
did literally “line upon line,” almost wythe upon wythe multiply its
seed, if not quite like the sand of the sea, yet freely. Proofs of this
fecundity exist in the varying and world-wide forms of its issue. A
strong family likeness enables us roughly to divide these descendants
into two classes.</p>

<p>The first (A) where (to quote our leading law case) “the human
element” is absent, as in night lining, or in “trimmering,” or in
its distant and nowadays probably illegal connection, the method of
live-baiting for pike with the aid of a goose or a duck, as set forth
by T. Barker with his customary gusto.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>The second (B) where “the human element” is present, as in
hand-lining and in its very latest descendant, invented for “big game
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
fishing” off Santa Catalina, viz. a line attached to a kite, which
device secures the required “skittering” along the surface and from
wave to wave of the flying fish-bait.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
Even this very up-to-date device is no new invention. In the Malayan
Archipelago and many Melanesian islands a kite has long been employed,
sometimes as in the Solomon group, with a hookless bait of a spider’s
web, which, as wool with eels, gets itself firmly entangled in the
small teeth of the Gar fish.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Next arose, as snags and obnoxious branches in primitive days
abounded, and water bailiffs did not, the further crux, not quite
unknown even to-day, how to get the bait over the intervening
obstacles which the mere hand line was incapable of clearing, or how
to obtain the length necessary to place the bait properly before the
fish.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p class="space-below2">The difficulty was in time overcome by
attaching the tackle, wythe, gorge, and bait to the hunting Spear. It
is at this stage I claim that the hunting Spear with wythe, gorge,
and bait so attached became, in fact for all purposes was, the
original pole, or at any rate was the immediate sire by a more springy
sapling of what in the procession of the ages was to attain unto the
“tremendous,” if at times unmastered, “majesty” of our modern Rod.</p>

and others are correct in their conjectures that our primitive
<i>piscator</i>, when endeavouring to catch by hand fish half stranded
or spawning in small pools, blocked any little exit by plaited
twigs—wattling, according to C. F. Keary, was one of the earliest
prehistoric industries—or stones, that they erected in fact the world’s
first barrage, then must this ascendant or Scotch cousin of the Net
take precedence of the Spear and every other artificial device.</p>

<p>Of the Net’s kith and kin are there not some scores specified
in the <i>Onomasticon</i> of Julius Pollux, or depicted in M. Dabry
de Thiersant’s <i>Pisciculture en Chine</i>? The Net was to beget a
<i>progeniem</i> to the Angler at any rate <i>vitiosiorem</i>, and (to drag in
another tag) almost like κυμάτων ἀνήριθμον γέλασμα.</p>

<p>Three of this big family stand out conspicuous by their diversity.
(A) The fairy-like Net—perhaps the most interesting because the most
incredible—made by <i>Spiders</i> and used by the Papuans.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
(B) The “Vimineous Weel” of Oppian. (C) The huge steel trawls, which
lately encompassed those ravening sharks of the sea, the German submarines.</p>

<p>How the following device should be classed, I am not sure; it is
neither Spear, nor Hook, nor Net. But it deserves to be put on record
as an ingenious and successful species of fishing, employed by the
Cretans during the War.</p>

<p>According to Mr. J. D. Lawson, Fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge
(to whom I am indebted for the account), the natives, eager to
recover the coal that ships while coaling dropped into the sea, set
out to <i>fish</i> for it. Since the coal could not swallow the bait, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
resolved that the bait should grip the coal. Having by means of a
rude spy-glass located the position of the mineral, they lowered
from a boat a cord to which an octopus—the larger the better—was
secured. As the fish detested the sensation of suspension, the moment
he touched bottom he clutched with all his tentacles any solid object
within reach, and while being drawn up clung to it with might and main.</p>

<p>By this method of inverted fishing—whether a survival of “Minoan
Culture” or an adaptation from the East, where for many centuries the
octopus has been similarly used for catching fish—much coal and much
else was retrieved from the sea.</p>

<p class="blockquot2"> <span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Since the above
was written Th. Mainage has published at Paris <i>Les Religions de la
préhistoire</i>. “Rites de Chasse” (ch. viii.) includes a section on magic
(pp. 326-342) and on religion (pp. 342-9), both dealing with fishing,
etc., ancient and modern. The sermon preached among the Hurons to the
fish recalls that of St. Anthony of Padua. Mainage, on p. 344, fig.
188, gives an incised design from Laugerie-Basse, which according to
him represents “Pêcheurs armés de filets (?).” The design is as little
convincing as the author by his query seems convinced.</p>

<div class="chapter"><p class="f150"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<h3>PART II</h3>
</div>

<p class="center">“Except to politicians, a decent definition is a help
and a delight.”</p>

<p>Acting on this American dictum I start with two definitions, one of
Fishing and Angling, the other of Angling. The first we owe to that
past master of the art, Plato. Whether it come within the category of
“delight or help,” or whether he can endorse the verdict of Theætetus
as to its “satisfactory conclusion,” each reader must decide.</p>

<p>Plato, using the method of elimination and incidentally more than
three pages of print, eventually arrives at the following definition
of Fishing and Angling:<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
“Then, now you and I have come to an understanding, not only about the
name of the Angler’s art, but about the definition of the thing itself.
One half of all Art was acquisitive: one half of the acquisitive Art
was conquest or taking by force: half of this again was hunting, and
half of hunting was hunting animals: of this again the under half was
fishing, and half of fishing was striking: a part of striking was
fishing with a barb, and one half of this again (being the kind which
strikes with a hook and draws the fish from below upwards) is the Art
we have been seeking, and which from the nature of the operation is
denoted Angling or drawing up.”</p>

<p><i>Theætetus:</i> “The result has been quite satisfactorily brought out.”</p>

<p>In search of a more helpful definition I turn to the English
Dictionaries. The <i>N.E.D.</i> (<i>New English Dictionary</i>, Oxford)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
gives Fishing—“to catch, or try to catch fish”—wide enough for all
our purpose and for most of our performances! In their definitions
of Angling, Angle, etc., the majority of dictionaries disagree, but
unite in deriving Angle from the Aryan root, ANK = to bend, and
establishing the fishing term as the cousin of the awkward angles of
Euclid and of our youth. The <i>N.E.D.</i> in its definitions of ‘Angle’
(sb.), of ‘Angle’ (vb.), of ‘Angler,’ or of ‘Angling,’ does not even
agree with itself.</p>

<p>Thus we find:</p>

<div class="blockquot1">
<p>(A) “Angle (sb.), a fish hook: often in later use extended to the
line, or tackle, to which it is fastened, and the Rod to which this
is attached. See Book of St. Alban’s (title of ed. 2), <i>Treatyse
perteynynge</i> to <i>Hawkynge,</i> <i>Huntynge, and Fysshynge with an
Angle</i>.”</p>

<p>(B) “Angle (vb.), to use an angle: to fish with a hook <i>and
bait</i>.”</p>

<p>(C) “Angler, one who fishes with a hook and <i>line</i>.”</p>

<p>(D) “Angling, the action or art of fishing with a
<i>rod</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>
</div>

<p>If A, B, C, which all differ, are accurate, D can hardly be so.
Further from A, B, C, we can deduce no correct definition of D.</p>

<p>Under D the <i>N.E.D.</i> imports as a necessary component part of angling
the presence of a rod, but I venture to think on insufficient
grounds. In the first quotation cited in support, “Fysshynge, callyd
Anglynge with a rodde,” the word “rodde,” if D hold good, must be
redundant or unnecessary. “Rodde” I hold to be an added word of
limitation, or description, as in “Fysshynge with an <i>Angle</i>.”</p>

<p>But since the dictionaries do hardly help—to some, indeed, they
smack of “the heinous crime of word-splitting”—and since the
importance (apart from etymological reasons) of possessing an
accurate and adequate definition presses, let us prostrate ourselves
before another oracle, the Law. But here too success scarcely crowns
our quest. The leading case, <i>Barnard</i> v. <i>Roberts and Williams</i>,
yields, Delphic-like, little light or leading.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
The facts, briefly stated, were: Roberts and Williams laid in a
private river two fishing lines; one end of the lines attached to two
pieces of wood driven into the ground made fast the lines, the other
end held hooks baited with worms, and a stone to keep the lines under
water. “The lines were left by the men, who subsequently were found
taking two fish off the hooks, and resetting the lines, of which the
keepers deprived them. The charge (under s. 24 of the Larceny Act of
1861) ran of unlawfully, etc., taking fish otherwise than by angling.
The Justices of Bangor refused to commit, on the ground that they
were angling, and thus under the Act were protected from damages or
penalty for such angling.”</p>

<p>On appeal both sides cited Izaak Walton and other authors; both
quoted the <i>N.E.D.</i>—the appellant its definition of ‘Angling,’
<i>i.e.</i> fishing with a rod, and the respondent that of ‘Angle’ (vb.),
<i>i.e.</i> to fish with hook and bait.</p>

<p>The three Judges, judge-like, disagreed in their reasons but agreed
in allowing the appeal, and disagreeing in their conceptions of
angling agreed in abstaining from any definition.</p>

<p>“In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed is king.” Mr. Justice
Phillimore was the least non-positive. He even committed himself to
the following: “He did not think that a rod must necessarily be part
of an angler’s outfit, but only a hook and line. He thought <i>the
human element</i> must be present, and that it was not sufficient when
the tackle was set once and for all, and then left.”</p>

<p>It is obvious from the above that, while the dictionaries are but
blind guides, the Law (if on this occasion not exactly “a hass”)
fails to elucidate what exactly constitutes Angling.</p>

<p>Dr. Henry van Dyke, the author of <i>Little Rivers</i> and other
fascinating books connected with fishing, suggests to me “Angling,
the art of fishing by hand with a hook and line, with or without
a rod.” I much prefer this to that of <i>N.E.D.</i>, because of its
greater accuracy and of its inclusion of that really skilful method,
hand-lining. But for general convenience I adopt as the definition of
Angling “<i>The action, or art, of fishing with a Rod.</i>”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p><i>My Fishing from the Earliest Times</i> treats of the Old Stone Men,
Egyptians, Assyrians, Chinese, Jews, Greeks, and Romans. The amount
of space allotted to the last two, compared with that occupied
by some of the other nations, may suggest the immortal even if
apocryphal chapter of “<i>Snakes in Ireland</i>.” “There are none.”</p>

<p>To any such criticisms I make answer that for nearly all our
knowledge as to the methods and tackle of fishing and varieties of
fish we are indebted to the Greeks and Romans, and in a smaller
degree to the Egyptians and Chinese.</p>

<p>Reasons of date, data, and dearth of paper prevent my using in this
book the material which I had collected on Indian, Persian, and
Japanese Fishing.</p>

<p>As regards India, while fishing by net falls well within my adopted
date (500 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), that by hook and line—not necessarily
Angling—gains entrance by a short head, or a mere century.</p>

<p>Fish (<i>matsya</i>, apparently derived from the root <i>mad</i> and signifying
<i>the inebriated</i>) is down to <i>c.</i> 1000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> only mentioned
once<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
in the <i>Rigveda</i>, X. 68, 8. In the next period—that of the later
Vedas and Brāhmanas—fish, but not methods of capture, find frequent mention.</p>

<p>The Net (<i>jāla</i>) is first referred to in the <i>Atharvaveda</i> (not later
than 800 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) but not in connection with fishing, while in
the <i>Yajurveda</i> (<i>c.</i> 800 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) names for fishermen and a
hook—<i>baḍiša</i>—occur. The 139th <i>Jātaka</i> (<i>c.</i> 400 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>)
contains the first allusion to fishing with a <i>line</i> and hook.</p>

<p>References in Sanskrit poetry to the iron hook and bait probably
imply, though they fail to mention, the Rod. Passages in the epic
<i>Mahābhārata</i>, V. 1106 (<i>c.</i> 200 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), in Kāmandaki’s
aphoristic poetry (<i>c.</i> 300-400 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), in the <i>Pancatantra</i>,
I. 208, “when women see a man caught in the bonds of love, they draw
him like a fish that has followed the bait,” all suggest Angling.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Fish legends, similes, stories—not always redounding to ichthyic
wisdom—meet us fairly frequently. Manu<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
is saved from the Flood by a fish. Buddha<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
answers questions as to abstention from fish. Wondrous fish occur:
<i>e.g.</i> the <i>Kar</i>, “which knows to the scratch of a needle’s point
by how much the water in the Ocean shall increase, by how much it is
diminishing.”<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>Stories, such as the recovery by a fish of Šakuntalā’s ring and
the consequent marriage of King Dushyanta; of Indra, the fearless
slayer of the serpent, whose death for defiling the bed of Ahalyâ was
compassed by fish;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
of Adrikâ’s transformation into a fish and her conception in that form of a child by
King Uparicaras;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
of <i>The Stupid and Two Clever Fishes</i>;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> of <i>The Frog and The Two Fish</i>,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
all these make pleasant if varied reading. But when we come to
<i>methods</i> of fishing, all variety vanishes. We are confronted with a
damnable monotony, a <i>toujours perdrix</i>. It is almost Net, or Nothing.</p>

<p>This holds true of the piscine tales even in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>,
<i>e.g.</i> <i>The Fisherman and the Jinn</i>, and <i>The Fisherman and the
’Efreet</i>. The latter, however, possesses an unique interest: the
fisherman here, unlike his Greek and Roman poverty-stricken brethren,
became by means of his miraculous fish, “the wealthiest of the people
of his age, and his daughters continued to be the wives of princes”!</p>

<p>Evidence that fishing in India was of old and is now (the fishing
caste, I am told, ranks low) not highly regarded can be deduced
(<i>inter alia</i>) from its total omission in the Fourteen Sciences and
the Sixty-four Arts, which the <i>Vātsyặyana Kāma Sūtra</i> (not later
than the third century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) promulgates for the education
of children from five to sixteen. Among the requisite Sciences
gymnastics, dancing, the playing of musical glasses, sword-stick,
cock quail and ram fighting, teaching parrots and starlings to sing,
all these find commendation, but fishing none!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>As with India, so with Persia ancient and modern, <i>toujours le
filet</i>! Very many of the earliest prose works in modern Persian
came through the Pahlavi from the Sanskrit. Thus the three or
four stories—occasionally but wrongly regarded as of Persian
origin—about fish and fishing which are contained in the
<i>Anwār-i-Suhaili</i><a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
can be traced to <i>The Fables of Bidpai</i>, or <i>The
Pancatantra</i>,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
translated from the Arabic version into Persian about 550
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>

<p>In modern Persian (<i>c.</i> 1000 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) poetry, lines allusive
to fishing dot themselves sparsely:<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
even in them the Net bulks biggest. Hafiz (fourteenth century),
however, gives us</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“I have fallen into a Sea of Troubles, (presumably tears),</span>
<span class="i4">So that my Beloved may catch me with a Hook” (a curl of hair).</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A passage in Arabic furnished hope of finding Angling oases in the
desert, but when in</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A fish whose jaw the gaff of Death had pierced,”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>I found the word (<i>saffūd</i>) rendered <i>gaff</i> given by Richardson’s
<i>Persian-Arabic Dictionary</i> as “a roasting spit, a poker for the
fire,” my hope fled, for I quickly realised here an instance of
anachronistic translation, or the employment of fishing terms
appropriate to modern but inapplicable to ancient methods.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>I have come to the sad conclusion that the Persians ancient and
modern care not in general for fishing or angling, although the Gulf,
from which the ancient Sumerians garnered such splendid “harvest
of the sea,” washes their shores, and from their mountains descend
“fishful” streams. I have reached my conclusion for the following reasons:—
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot1">
<p>(A) There is no word in the language which properly expresses
<i>fish</i>-hook. Arabic words, which strictly mean <i>grappling</i> hooks, have
been adopted or adapted. In modern Arabic itself these words are not
used for a <i>fish-hook</i>: bâlûgh, a foreign term, prevails.</p>

<p>(B) In Persian, Arabic, and Turkish<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
the expression <i>to</i> <i>fish</i>, literally translated, equals <i>to hunt
fish</i>, and generally describes a man who makes his living by <i>netting</i>,
and selling fish.</p>

<p>(C) There is no word for fishing-rod in Wollaston’s great
English-Persian Dictionary.</p>

<p>(D) Proverbs are usually the offspring and embodiment of the
life and occupations of a nation. In both ancient and modern
Persian there is, as far as I know, but one proverb—and that rather
contemptful—allusive to fish or fishing. It runs, “Thou shall not make
a fish thine enemy,” which probably signifies that no foe, however
unlikely to injure, can be despised.</p>

<p>(E) In the experiences related to me by the Rev. Dr. St. Clair
Tisdall, and by the late Sir Frank Lascelles, Netting ousts Angling.</p>
</div>

<p>The former:<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
“’Though I have lived in Persia for many years and have travelled
through it from Sea to Sea, from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian, I
have never seen a fish-hook in a Persian’s hands. In the districts I
know best, the Net is the only weapon.”</p>

<p>The second, when our Minister at Teheran, on his first holiday
went a-fishing. Having caught on a likely stream before supper three
or four half-pound trout (I think), he anticipated next day pleasant
sport. With the very early morning came not Remorse, but the local
Sheikh to do his reverence and to make the customary present. “As I
have heard that His Great Excellency worked hard for a few fish last
night, my tribesmen have netted the river for the length of a parasang,
and I bring you plenty of fish.” Tableau! Hasty flight of Sir Frank to
another river, with like results!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Reasons both of date and data prevent my including the Japanese,
perhaps the most alert and adaptive sea-fishers in the world. As
their history before 500 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> must apparently be classed as
legendary, this nation eludes my chronological Net. Data on ancient
fishing, if existing, are either unknown<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
or as being derived from China find place <i>postea</i>.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>I set the time limit of my book at roughly 500 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, so as to
include the last classical or quasi-classical piscatory poems <i>viz.</i>
those of Ausonius—notably <i>ad Mosellam</i>—in the fourth and of Sidonius
in the fifth century.</p>

<p>This date seems, indeed, a pre-ordained halting-place for three
reasons. First, the tackle of our day (though improved almost beyond
recognition in rod, winch, artificial bait, etc.) is merely the lineal
descendant of the Macedonian described by Ælian in the third century
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Second, between Ælian and Dame Juliana’s <i>Boke</i> no
record, with two possible exceptions, of fishing with a fly exists.
Third, and more important, we possess no real continuous link between
the Angling literature of Rome down to the fifth century and that which
sprang up after the invention of printing some thousand years later.</p>

<p>In the intervening centuries, it is true, books and manuscripts were
written (mainly by monks) which treated more or less of fishing, but of
Angling only incidentally.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
They illustrate the customs of fishermen, the natural history of fish,
the making and maintaining of <i>vivaria</i> or fish-ponds, rather than
instruct or inform on practical Fishing.</p>

<p>The most notable would, could we trace it, be “an old MS. treatise on
fishing, found among the remains of the valuable library belonging
to the Abbey of St. Bertin, at St. Omer. A paper on this was read, a
few years before 1855, at a society of antiquaries at Arras. From its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
style, the MS. was supposed to have been written about 1000 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,
and to have been divided into twenty-two chapters. The author’s main
object was to prove that fishers had been singularly favoured by Divine
approbation; but appended to the MS. was a full list of all <i>river</i>
fish, the baits used for taking them, and the suitable seasons for
angling for each sort of fish.”</p>

<p>For the existence of this work, vanished now for over sixty years,
we have only the authority of Robert Blakey.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
But this, if it do pass muster with Dr. Turrell, fails to satisfy
Westwood and Satchell, who describe his book on Angling as “a slipshod
and negligent work, devoid of all utility, a farrago of quotations
incorrectly given, and of so-called original passages, the vagueness
and uncertainty of which rob them of all weight and value. Mr. Blakey’s
volume, it is but fair to add, is redeemed from utter worthlessness by
the excellent bibliographical catalogue appended to it by the
<i>publisher</i>!”<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Geoponika</i>, whether written or redacted by Cassianus Bassus or
Cassius Dionysius, or merely translated from a treatise by an ancient
Carthaginian author, treats generally of agriculture. The twentieth
book, however, deals with fish-ponds, fishing, and baits: unlike the
Roman writers on <i>vivaria</i>, who tell us nothing as to the capture of
the fish in them, the writer gives us instructive tips on baits.</p>

<p>One infallible recipe in chap. xviii. for collecting the fish—on the
lines of Baiting the Swim—from its superstitious <i>naïveté</i> compels
quotation: “Get three limpets, and having taken out the fish therein,
inscribe on the shell the words, Ἰαώ Σαβαώθ, or ‘Jehovah, Lord of
Hosts’; you will immediately see the fish come to the same place in a
surprising manner.”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
The two Greek words formed the so-called Gnostic formula and occur
frequently on amulets, etc. The <i>Geoponika</i> adds immediately, “this
name the Ichthyophagi use.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>About the fourteenth century a poem entitled <i>De Vetula</i>, attributed
to R. de Fournival, got translated or imitated by Jean Lefevre. The
fishing portion (68 lines) awakes our interest, as it shows that “more
than six hundred years ago, and probably two hundred years before the
date of <i>The Boke of St. Albans</i>, most of the modern modes of fishing
were practised; for instance, the worm, the fly, the torch and spear,
the night line, the eel-basket and fork,” etc.</p>

<p>This quotation from Westwood and Satchell might cause a casual reader
to suppose that (α) from <i>De Vetula</i>, written only some two centuries
before <i>The Boke of St. Albans</i>, we gain our first information “of
these modes of fishing,” and (β) that these were “modern,” whereas
Oppian had described them all, some thirteen hundred years before <i>The
Boke of St. Albans</i> saw light.</p>

<p>With the exception of de Fournival and the elusive MS. of Dom
Pichon,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
which (written about 1420 but only rediscovered about 1853)
probably stamps this monk as the first to practise artificial hatching,
the Continent produced practically nothing till the appearance at
Antwerp in 1492 of the first printed original book on Fishing, which as
regards printing precedes <i>The Boke of St. Albans</i>.</p>

<p>This little Flemish work by an unknown author contains twenty-six
chapters of a few lines, gives recipes for artificial baits, unguents,
and pastes, and in the last two pages notes the periods when certain
fish eat best. As its title sets out, it teaches “how one may catch
birds and fish with one’s hands, and also otherwise.”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
The earliest description of fishing in the English language meets us
in <i>The Colloquy of Aelfric</i>, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 995, which Skeat first
brought to notice and first “Englished” in <i>The Oldest English Treatise
on Fishing</i>.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
This takes the form of a short dialogue introduced into the <i>Colloquy</i>
written by Aelfric, Archbishop of Canterbury, for the purpose of
teaching his pupils Latin, and therefore written in Anglo-Saxon with a
Latin translation beneath. “It is arranged as a conversation between
the master and his pupil; the latter in turns figuring as huntsman,
fisherman, falconer.”</p>

<p>The length of the <i>Colloquy</i>, even of the fishing portion, prevents
inclusion here, but the pupil’s objection to fishing in the sea,
“because rowing is troublesome to me,” and to going a-whaling, “because
I had rather catch a fish I can kill than one that can, with one
stroke, kill both me and my comrades,” strikes me as well taken and
pertinent.</p>

<p>A poem by Piers of Fulham, written about 1420 (the original MS.
of which can be seen at Trinity College, Cambridge) claims next
our notice. The author, judging from Hartshorne’s rendering, fully
justifies the description of him as a somewhat pessimistic angler.
He seems to have anticipated De Quincey’s “fishing is an unceasing
expectation and a perpetual disappointment.” He fully appreciated
its difficulties and disappointments, but clearly possessed some
sportsmanlike instincts, as the following, among other, verses
show<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>A Latin book <i>Dialogus creaturarum optime moralizatus</i> was published in
1480; a translation about 1520 styles it <i>The Dialogues of Creatures
Moralysed</i>. This very rare work, which I have found fully dealt with
from an Angler’s point of view only by Dr. Turrell, furnishes the
earliest known illustration of an angler fishing with a float.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Next in date, and last to be noticed here, comes the famous <i>Treatyse
of Fysshynge with an Angle</i>, printed at Westminster by Wynkyn de Worde
in 1496 as part of the second edition of <i>The Boke of St. Albans</i>.
Whether, as has been commonly supposed, Dame Juliana Berners wrote it,
or whether any such lady ever existed, are points of controversy, but
that <i>The Treatyse</i> was not an immaculate conception, without parents
or ancestors, can be reasonably proved by its reference to earlier
writers on fishing, and to its “these ben the xii flies ye shall use” being
introduced as a precept of practice rather than a revelation of invention.</p>

<p>If few the forbears of what some term “not only the first angling
manual in England, but also the first practical work written in any
language,” its vitality and its prolific progeny admit of no doubt.
According to Mr. A. Lang (who accounts for the startling fact by
the increased number of people able to read owing to the spread of
education) no less than ten editions of <i>The Boke</i> were issued within
four years of publication, while Dr. Turrell limits himself to fourteen
undated editions between 1500 and 1596.</p>

<p>Whatever the number of the editions, the need for and the vitality of
<i>The Treatyse</i> is demonstrated by the fact that for over a hundred
years no new work on Angling was printed in England, and between it
and <i>The Compleat Angler</i>—a space of over one hundred and fifty
years—there occur but four books on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
To its prolific progeny, the <i>Bibliotheca Piscatoria</i> bears
witness<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
in its catalogue of some fifteen hundred authors and of countless books, MSS. etc.</p>

<p>We owe, it is said, this voluminous literature to the geographical
position of England, which lends itself very favourably to the
pursuit of all kinds of fishing. Can we, also, flatteringly add the
other factor of Lacépède’s dictum, “Il y a cette différence entre la
chasse et la pêche, que cette dernière convient aux peuples les plus civilisés?”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>But the pursuit of fishing did not prevail in early England or
Scotland. A passage in Bede (probably used by Henry of Huntingdon),
which has, I think, escaped the many-eyed net of our fishing authors,
testifies to its absence in the former.</p>

<p>St. Wilfrid (born 634) on his return from Friesland, where fishing
yielded the staple of food, met with such success in his mission to the
South Saxons that he not only converted them, “with all the priests
of the Idols,” but also—“which was a great relief unto them”—taught
them the craft of fishing, of which, save eeling, they wotted naught.
Collecting under the Saint’s order eel-nets where they could, the first
adventurers <i>meritis sui patris Divina largitate adjuti</i><a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
enmeshed three hundred fishes, which they equally divided between the
poor, the net-owners, and themselves.</p>

<p>The Celtæ, with some exceptions such as the scomber-catching Celtiberi,
eschewed fish, probably from religious prejudices, which owing to their
adoration of the springs, rivers, and waters prevented the eating of
their denizens.</p>

<p>Whatever the cause, Dion Cassius expressly comments on the abstinence
of the Caledonians, although their seas and rivers abounded with
food.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
In time the example of the clergy and the ordinance of fast
days gradually overcame—save in the case of Eels, which still remain
to the Highlander an abomination—their obstinate antipathy. Across
St. George’s Channel the Irish two centuries ago “had little skill in
catching fish.”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>But when the Western Highlanders did go a-fishing, their prayers and
promises—prompted by the same principle of gratitude being a sense of
favours to come—echo the prayers and promises, <i>Dis mutatis</i>, of the
<i>Anthologia Palatina</i>.</p>

<p>The seas differ, but the gods precated are the same. If in the
following verses you substitute for “Christ, King of the Elements”
Poseidon, King of the Waters, for “brave Peter” ruseful Hermes, and for
“Mary fair” Aphrodite, you have the tutelary deities of fishing. The
spirit of the prayer and promise of the firstling remain unchanged.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>For century after century the fishermen of the Isles have handed down
orally to generation after generation the Gaelic prayer with which they
set out to sea.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The rarity—I have not met its mention—and curious nature of a volume
published at Frankfort in 1611, even if more than a century after <i>The
Boke of St. Albans</i>, compels some reference.</p>

<p><i>Conjecturæ Halieuticæ</i> by Raphael Eglinus consists of a long
dissertation based on the strange markings of three fishes (pictured on
its title-page), two caught in Scandinavia on the same day, November
21, 1587, and the third in Pomerania on May 21, 1596. These markings,
supposedly chronological, provide their author with a basis for various
prophecies and warnings of the evils to come in Central Europe,
especially in Germany.</p>

<p>As neither text nor type peculiarly tempt to perusal, I have not found
it easy to disentangle the disasters or allot to each country its
individual woe. Deductions from Daniel, the patriarch Joseph, and of
course the Apocalypse enable Eglinus to establish definitely to his
own satisfaction the future advent, in one or other of the Central
Kingdoms, of Antichrist.</p>

<p>Nor, again, is it easy to gather whether a time-limit is set for his
appearance, or whether the prophecies apply to twentieth-century
events. Alas! also, the data do not enable me with certainty from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
very promising entries from Germany, Austria, and Bulgaria to single
out the precise potentate who best fills the bill, or closest answers
to the author’s Antichrist.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Space debars from one fascinating branch of my subject—the
superstitions of Fishing. Their far-flung web enclosed the ancient
<i>piscator</i> more firmly than his brother <i>venator</i>, or, indeed,
any class save only the “medicine men” of Rome.</p>

<p>Nor could their successors disentangle themselves, as witness the
recipe given above by Bassus for inscribing on the limpets’ shell
the Gnostic formula, and Mr. Westwood’s words, “There is, in fact,
more quaint and many-coloured superstition in a single page of Old
Izaak than in all the forty-five chapters of the twentieth Book of
the Geoponika. Silent are they touching mummies’ dust and dead men’s
feet—silent on the fifty other weird and ghastly imaginations of the
later anglers.”<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>And even the modern angler, if he thoroughly examine himself, must
confess that some shred of gossamer still adheres. Does he not at times
forgo, even if he boast himself incredulous of consequence, some act,
such as stepping across a rod, lest it bring bad luck? If particular
individuals rise superior, the ordinary fisherman in our present day
still avows and still clings to superstitions or omens. Let him in the
South of Ireland be asked whither he goes, meet a woman, or see one
magpie, and all luck vanishes.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
A dead hare (<i>manken</i>) regarded as a devil or witch a century ago brought
<i>piscator</i> nigh unto swooning.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Women seem usually fatal to good catches; as one instance out of many
we read in Hollinshed’s <i>Scottish Chronicle</i>, that “if a woman wade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
through the one fresh river in the Lewis, there shall no salmon be seen
there for a twelvemonth after.”</p>

<p>Superstitions of every sort and almost incredible dictate to the
ancient and to the modern fisherman what are the good and what the bad
days for plying his craft, or setting his sail. Their cousin, imitative
magic, plays no small part in deciding his bait.</p>

<p>But enough here of fishing superstitions. Are they not writ large
in Pliny, Oppian, Plutarch, in the <i>Folk Lore Records</i>, and larger,
geographically, in that masterpiece, <i>The Golden Bough</i>?</p>

<p>The most incredulous, if there were one chance in a hundred of the
operation ensuring adeptness in our craft, would willingly sacrifice in
conformity with Australian superstition the first joint of his little
finger.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
Nor, again, if only the most moderate success resulted, would any of us
utter a belated plaint at his mother imitating her Fijian sister and
throwing, when first a-fishing after childbirth, his navel-string into
the sea, and thus “ensuring our growing into good fisherfolk.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br /><span class="h_subtitle">HOMER—THE POSITION OF FISHERMEN</span></h3>
</div>

<p>It is difficult to define accurately or trace separately the Lure
or the Lore of these two nations, for their methods of fishing were
practically the same or dove-tailed one into the other. Since our
authors in both languages frequently synchronise, or as in the case of
Pliny and Ælian the younger tongue antedates the elder by a century or
more, and since this book is based on no zoological system, I shall
deal with them for the most part in chronological order.</p>

<p>The opposite page reproduces the figures of the four fishermen from
the famous Fishermen’s Vase of Phylakopi discovered in Melos some
twenty years ago.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
If the period assigned to this, viz. <i>c.</i> 1500 <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span>, be accurate, it seems to be the oldest Greek
representation, at any rate in the Ægean area, depicting anything
connected with fishing, and antedates the earliest Greek author by four
to nine hundred years, in accordance with the varying ages allotted to the
Homeric poems.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
It is to Homer, whether written by half a dozen different authors or in
half a dozen different centuries,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
as the oldest Greek writer extant that we naturally turn for
information about fishermen and fishing. His evidence is not only the
earliest, but also the most trustworthy, according to Athenæus. “Homer
treats of the art of fishing with greater accuracy than professional
writers on the subject such as Cæcilius, Oppian, etc.”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
—an endorsement from the piscatorial side of the Theocritean ἅλις πάντεσσιν Ὅμηρος.</p>

<p>Neither fishermen nor traders in the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> possess any
real status. While farmers, more especially pastoral farmers, occupy
an acknowledged and—next to the chiefs and warriors—the highest
position, no fisherman or trader is regarded as a representative unit
of the body, politic or social, or as a contributor to the wealth of
the tribe or state, a condition with which that of the fisherfolk in
ancient Egypt <a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
and in China, both in early times and in the present day, is elsewhere
compared and contrasted.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
“For trader Homer knows no word.”<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
As <i>traders</i> he represents no Greeks, although the Taphians approximate
closely (<i>Od.</i>, I. 186). For this three reasons have been assigned:—</p>

<p>First, the Greeks of Homer’s time with the exception of the Phæacians,
“who care not for bow or quiver, but for masts, and oars of ships, and
gallant barques, wherein rejoicing, they cross the grey sea” (<i>Od.</i>,
VI. 270), hardly impress us, despite Dr. Leaf’s “The whole attitude of
both the Poems is one of maritime daring,”<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> as adventurous sailors.</p>

<p>They disliked long sea voyages; they shrank from spending the night on
the water; they would go thrice the distance, if they could but keep in
touch with land—and naturally enough, when we remember that for the
Homeric boat the Ægean was safe for only a few months of the year.</p>

<p>Their food supply made the sea a hateful necessity. “As much as a
mother is sweeter than a stepmother, so much is earth dearer than the
grey sea” might have been written as appropriately by Homer as by
Antipater centuries later.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Whatever trading existed was in the hands not of the Phæacians, but
of the Phœnicians, to whose great port Sidon Homer makes reference
more than once.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
Boldness of navigation, plus guile and gainfulness, characterised the
nation; their “tricky trading” (cf. the Levantines of our day)<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
found frequent comment.</p>

<p>A comparison of them with the seamen of Elizabeth’s time shows common
traits. Both were “the first that ever burst into the silent seas,”
both committed acts of piracy, both kidnapped and enslaved freely. Lest
it be objected that the evidence of <i>Od.</i>, XIV. 297 and 340 occurs in a
fictitious account by Odysseus of himself and so is itself fictitious,
let us call as witness the Hebrew prophet Joel<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>:
“What have ye to do with Me, O Tyre and Zidon? The children, also, of Judah,
and the children of Jerusalem, have ye sold unto the sons of the Grecians.”</p>

<p>The second reason lies in the fact that each Homeric house or each
hamlet, although perhaps not each town, apparently supplied nearly all
its own wants and was practically self-supporting.</p>

<p>The chief crafts existed, as Hesiod shows, but only in a rudimentary
stage; workers there were in gold, silver, bronze, wood, leather,
pottery, carpentry. Although they were not “adscripti glebæ,” the
proper pride or narrow jealousy of each settlement was strongly
averse from calling in craftsmen from outside. Only apparently those
“workers for the people,” such as “a prophet, or a healer of ills, or
a shipwright, or a godlike minstrel who can delight all by his song,”
were free to come and go, as they willed, sure of a welcome: “These are
the men who are welcome over all the wide earth.”<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
The third reason was due to nearly all ordinary trade being effected by
barter. Payment was in kine, kind, or service. The ox, probably because
all round the most important of possessions, constituted the ordinary
measure of value: thus a female slave skilled in embroidery fetches
four oxen. Laertes gives twenty for Eurycleia, while much-wooed maidens
by gifts from their successful suitors “multiply oxen” for their fathers.</p>

<p>Mentes sails to Temesa with a cargo of “shining iron” to exchange for
copper.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
Then again in <i>Il.</i>, VII. 472 ff., “the flowing-haired Achæans bought
them wine thence, some for bronze and some for gleaming iron, and some
with hides, and some with whole kine, and some with captives.” Among
the fishermen of the Indian Ocean, fish-hooks, on the same principle
of importance of possession, “the most important to them of all
implements, passed as currency and in time became a true money <i>larin</i>,
just as did the hoe in China.”<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>“The talents of gold,”<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
probably Babylonian shekels, whether Hultsch’s heavy or W. Ridgeway’s
light one, implied, according to some, a money standard of value. But
wrongly, because neither gold nor silver came to coinage in Greece or
anywhere else till long after Homer’s day.</p>

<p>Fishermen seem slowly to have acquired some sort of status. Ἁλιεύς,
at first meaning a seaman or one connected with the sea, in time
denoted also a fisherman. <i>Od.</i>, XIX. <span class="smcap">iii</span>,
characterises the well-ordered realm of a “blameless king” as one, in
which “the black earth bears wheat and barley, and trees are laden with
fruit, and sheep bring forth and fail not, and <i>the sea gives store of fish</i>.”</p>

<p>Any objection that such a kingdom had no actual existence, but was only
invented to heighten the hyperbole of laudation of Penelope’s fame,
“which goes up to the wide heaven, as doth the fame of a blameless
king,” concerns us not at all, for the kingdom whether actual or
imaginary is held up as worthy of all praise and admiration. In this our
Fish and so our Fishermen have attained some, if small, constituent status.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>The period of such attainment cannot be dated, but how and why the
status arrived I now try to trace.</p>

<p>Authorities differ widely as to whether the (so-called) Greeks, on
leaving Central Asia or whatever their <i>Urheimat</i>, established their
first lodgements in Europe or Asia, in Greece Proper or Asia Minor. E.
Curtius maintained that the Ionians at any rate, if not all the Greeks,
founded their earliest settlements on the coast of Asia Minor, and only
later crossed to Greece.</p>

<p>This view finds little favour among most Homeric scholars of the
present day,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
who reverse the theory. They place the first settlement of the
immigrant Greeks in European Greece, whence by peaceable permeation or
otherwise they subsequently colonised the coasts of Asia Minor and the Islands.</p>

<p>According to Professor K. Schneider<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
the Greeks, when swarming from their original Aryan hive and
establishing themselves on the coast of Asia Minor and in the Islands
of the Ægean Sea, carried with them and for a long time closely
preserved their original habits of life and livelihood. Descended from
generations of inland dwellers, eaters of the flesh of wild animals, of
sheep, etc., they were ignorant of marine fish as a food. Only when the
population increased more rapidly than the crops, did they, profiting
by their contact with the Phœnicians, to whom in seamanship<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> and, according to some writers, in art<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
they owed much, begin to realise and utilise the wealth of the harvest to be
won from the adjacent seas.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Fishing, followed at first mainly by the very poor to procure a food in
low esteem, gradually found itself.</p>

<p>In the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> no fish appear at banquets or in the
houses of the well-to-do: only in connection with the poorest or
starving do they obtain mention.</p>

<p>Meleager of Gadara accounted for this fact—previously noted by
Aristotle—by the suggestion that Homer represented his characters as
abstaining from fish, because as a Syrian by descent he himself was a
total abstainer. The curious omission of fish has been held to indicate
that Homer either lived before the adoption of fish as food, or, if
not, that the social conditions and habits of diet which he delineates
are those of generations before such transition.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>The decision, if one be possible, lies for Homeric scholars, and not
for a mere seeker after piscatoriana. Even to such an one, however, two
alternatives seem clear.</p>

<p>First, if Homer did live after the transition occurred, his
descriptions of ancient times and customs unconsciously included habits
and conditions of a more modern society.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Second, if he lived before such transition—a supposition, which
scarcely consists with the presence in Palæolithic <i>débris</i> of copious
remains of fish—passages such as <i>Od.</i>, XIX. 109-114, which ranks “a
sea-given store of fish” a constituent of a well-ordered realm, and
<i>Il.</i>, XVI. 746, where “This man would satisfy many by searching (or
diving) for oysters,” are interpolations by later writers.</p>

<p>It is difficult otherwise to reconcile or explain conflicting passages.
How, for instance, can the dictum, that “Fish as a food was in the
Poems only used by the very poor or starving,” be made to harmonise
with <i>Il.</i>, XVI. 746, just quoted?<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
If it be confined solely to the <i>Odyssey</i>, a more plausible case may
possibly be presented.</p>

<p>Another suggestion, not quite similar, yet not repugnant, is Seymour’s.
“The Poet represented the life which was familiar to himself and his
hearers. Each action, each event might be given by tradition, or might
be the product of the poet’s imagination, but the details which show
the customs of the age, and which furnish the colours of the picture,
are taken from the life of the poet’s time. His interest is centred in
the action of the story, and the introduction of unusual manners and
standard of life would only distract the attention of his hearers.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>Mackail, perhaps, concludes the whole matter. “The Homeric world is a
world imagined by Homer: it is placed in a time, evidently thought of
as far distant, though there are no exact marks of chronology any more
than there are in the Morte d’Arthur.”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Homer’s close knowledge of the many devices for the capture of fish,
and his lively interest in the habits of fish quite apart from actual
fishing seem inconsistent with Schneider’s contention of Greek ichthyic
ignorance.</p>

<p>Fish, as we have seen, came gradually to be considered as much a part
of natural wealth as the fruits of the ground or herds of cattle. And
yet in all the pictures with which Hephæstus adorns the Shield of
Achilles, pictures of common ever-present objects, first of the great
phenomena of Nature—Earth, Sea, Sun, Moon, and Stars—and then of the
various events and occupations that make up the round of human life—in
all these pictures, which as a series of illustrations of early life
and manners are obviously a document of first-rate importance, no form
of sea-faring has any place. Ships of war, maritime commerce, and
fishing are alike unrepresented.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>No satisfactory explanation of this omission has as yet seen the light.
The design of The Shield, say some, came from an inland country, such
as Assyria. Others that Homer described some foreign work of art
fabricated by people who knew not the sea, but Helbig points out that
the omission consists with the references to ships and sea-faring
elsewhere in Homer. No commerce or occupation, which could be placed
side by side with farming in a picture of Greek life, then existed. If
Mr. Lang’s view—which possesses the pleasant property of incapacity of
either proof or disproof—that The Shield was simply an <i>ideal</i> work of
art had been more generally borne in mind, we should have been spared
endless comment.</p>

<p>In his ascription of The Shield to Assyrian or Phœnician influence
Monro finds himself at variance with Sir Arthur Evans. Even if his
statement, “the recent progress of archæology has thrown so much light
on the condition of Homeric art,” be accurate and the deductions from
such recent progress be justifiable, the still more recent progress in
the same science (according to Evans) ousts the Assyrian or Phœnician
in favour of a Cretan parentage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is clear that some vanguard of the Aryan Greek immigrants came into
contact with this Minoan culture at a time when it was still in its
flourishing condition. The evidence of Homer is conclusive. Arms and
armour described in the poems are those of the Minoan prime; the fabled
Shield of Achilles, like that of Herakles described by Hesiod, with its
elaborate scenes and variegated metal work, reflects the masterpieces
of the Minoan craftsmen in the full vigour of their art. Even the lyre
to which the minstrel sang was a Minoan invention.”<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The suggestion that both authorities are really in agreement and that
the influence at work may be traced back ultimately to the early
Assyrian, <i>i.e.</i> <i>Sumerian</i>, culture, even if Evans holds “that the
first quickening impulse came to Crete from Egypt and not from the
Oriental side,” seems, on present data, untenable.</p>

<p>Till twenty years ago it was generally accepted that no character of
Homer ever sailed for recreation, or fished for sport. They were far
too near the primitive life to find any joy in such pursuits. Men
scarcely ever hunted or fished for mere pleasure. These occupations
were not pastimes; they were counted as hard labour. Hunting, fishing,
and laying snares for birds in Homer and even in the classical periods
had but one aim, food.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The Poet expressly mentions the hardships (ἂλγεα, <i>Od.</i>, IX. 121) of
hunters in traversing forest and mountains. Nowhere does he give any
indication of <i>sport</i> in hunting or fishing, except perhaps in the case
of the wild boar and in the delight of Artemis “taking her pastime in
the chase of boars and swift deer,”<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
where the word, παίζουσιν, would seem surely to indicate pleasure in sport.</p>

But the recent discovery at Tiryns of a fresco where two ladies are
depicted standing in a car at a boar-hunt<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
—perhaps “in at the death”—certainly makes for considerable
qualification, and, if succeeded by similar finds, for complete
reversal of the non-sporting theory.</p>

<p>On Circe’s Island, Odysseus strikes down “a tall antlered stag” as
“he was coming down from his pasture in the woodland to the river,
for verily the might of the Sun was sore upon him.” He bears the
“huge beast” across his neck to the black ship of his companions, who
soon devour it. This is the only mention of venison in Homer (<i>Od.</i>, X. 158 ff.).</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER II<br /><span class="h_subtitle">HOMER—METHODS OF FISHING</span></h3></div>

<p>Whether Homer lived before or after the adoption of fish as a food,
we find in the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> several references to fishing
with the Spear, the Net, the Hand-line, and the Rod.</p>

<p>It is a point of curious interest that nearly all the references,
where methods or weapons of fishing find mention, are made for the
purpose of or occur in a simile, which despite the so-called Higher
Criticism Mackail says, “In Homer reached perfection.”<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
A Homeric comparison, like the parable of the New Testament in its very
nature is intended to throw light from the more familiar upon what is
less familiar. The poet cannot intend to illustrate the moderately
familiar by what is wholly strange. In modern writers the subjects of
a simile, apart from those drawn from nature, are sometimes modern
or new; in the old they are almost invariably drawn from some well
established custom.</p>

<p>If so, it follows that to the Greeks of Homer’s time (as was the
case with the Egyptians before them) fishing with Spear, Net,
Line, and Rod were old and familiar devices.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
Which of the first three—Spear, Net, Line—ranks the oldest, has (as
shown in my <i>Introduction</i>) been long disputed and seems doubtful of
definite settlement.

   <p class="neg-indent">From Roman Mosaic at Sousse in <i>Revue Arch.</i>, 1897, Pl. xi.
      The top left corner (destroyed) no doubt showed angling. The men in the
      left-hand boat are using (according to P. Gauckler ‘relève des nasses’)
      bottle-shaped baskets.</p>

</div>

<p class="space-above2">The passages referring to fishing number eight.
Of the four methods of fishing mentioned one is with Spear (<i>Od.</i>, X.
124) two with the Net (<i>Od.</i>, XXII. 386; <i>Il.</i>, V. 487), and one with
the Rod (<i>Od.</i>, XII. 251).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>A. <i>The Spear</i> (<i>Od.</i>, X. 124): “And like folk spearing fishes they
bare home their hideous meal.” This gives a very lively image,
because the companions of Odysseus, whose boats had been smashed by
the thrown rocks, are in the water, and are being speared like fish
by the Læstrygones.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>B. <i>The Net</i> (<i>Od.</i>, XXII. 383 ff.): “But he” (Odysseus after the
slaughter of the suitors) “found all the sort of them fallen in their
blood in the dust, like fishes that the fishermen have drawn forth in
the meshes of the net into a hollow of the beach from out the grey
sea, and all the fish, sore longing for the salt waves, are heaped
upon the sand, and the sun shines forth and takes their life away: so
now the wooers lay heaped upon each other.”<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>In <i>Iliad</i>, V. 487 ff.: “Only beware lest, as though entangled in the
mesh of all-ensnaring flax, ye be made unto your foemen a prey and a spoil.”</p>

<p>C. <i>The Rod</i> (<i>Od.</i>, XII. 251 ff.): “Even, as when a fisher on some
headland<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
lets down with a long rod his baits for a snare to the little fishes
below, casting into the deep the horn of an ox of the homestead, and
as he catches each flings it writhing, so were they” (<i>i.e.</i> the
companions of Odysseus) “borne upward to the cliff” (by Scylla).</p>

<p>D. <i>Line and Hook</i> (<i>Iliad</i>, XXIV. 80 ff.): “And she” (Iris on her
Zeus-bidden mission) “sped to the bottom like a weight of lead, that
mounted on the horn of a field-ox goeth down, bearing death to the
ravenous fishes.”</p>

<p>E. <i>Iliad</i>, XVI. 406 ff.: “As when a man sits on a jutting rock and
drags a sacred fish from the sea with line and glittering hook of
bronze, so on the bright spear dragged he Thestor,” etc.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
F. <i>Odyssey</i>, IV. 368 f.: “Who” (the companions of Menelaus) “were
ever roaming round the isle, fishing with bent hooks, for hunger was
gnawing at their belly.”</p>

<p><i>Odyssey</i>, XII. 330 f.: “They” (the companions of Odysseus) “went
wandering with barbed hooks in quest of game, as needs they must,
fishes and fowls, whatever might come to their hand, for hunger
gnawed at their belly.”<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>The Rod finds one express mention—in passage C. Is its use implied
in passages D. and E.? The answer depends greatly on whether the
adjectives employed are really descriptive of the qualities and sizes
of the fish, or whether they are merely (as often the case in Homer)
ornamental or conventional epithets more suited for general than
particular use, or are redundant.</p>

<p>Our wonder, if the adjectives are really descriptive, grows by the
Rod being only specifically mentioned when “little fishes” are the
prey. If the contention of modern fishermen—the value of the rod as
an implement increases in proportion to the weight of the fish on
the hook—holds good, why does Homer cite the Rod in connection only
with “little” fishes, more especially as the prey in the simile (the
companions of Odysseus) can hardly be classed as “little”?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Four differing explanations are possible:—</p>

<div class="blockquot1">
<p>1. That “little” is an ornamental or redundant adjective.</p>

<p>2. That ῥάβδος, which is usually translated rod, <i>i.e.</i>
<i>fishing</i>-rod, is (according to Hayman and others) not a fishing-rod,
but merely a staff, or spear, shod with horn, and that “little”
signifies only fish suitable for food, not large fish, such as
dolphins, etc.</p>

<p>3. That the fishermen of Homer (anticipating our professional
deep-sea fishermen in Kent and the Channel Islands, who for quickness
and certainty, especially in the case of heavy fish, prefer
hand-lines to rods), limited the use of the Rod to “little,” <i>i.e.</i>
not large, fish.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>4. That “little” is partly ornamental, partly intentional, because
fish caught close inshore are normally smaller than those caught
farther out.</p>
</div>

<p>From the adjectives in passages D. and E. can we infer the use of the
Rod? Of the adjective in E., Butcher and Lang write: “It is difficult
to determine whether ἱερός in Homer does not sometimes retain its
primitive meaning of ‘strong’ (see Curtius, <i>Etym.</i>, No. 614); in
certain phrases, this may perhaps be accepted, as an archaism.... On
the whole we have not felt so sure of the archaic use as to adopt it
in our translation.”</p>

<p>Paley, “ἱερὸς means huge, as if a favourite of or dedicated to some
sea-god.” Was it from this shade of meaning that Theocritus in his
<i>Fisherman’s Dream</i><a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
drew his conception that certain fish might be κειμήλιον Ἀμφιτρίτας,
a pet of the sea-goddess? Faesi seems to incline to Paley’s view, but
for a more general reason: ἱερὸς equalling ἄνετος earmarks “all herds
and shoals of fish, especially those in the Sea, as consecrate to the Gods.”</p>

<p>Granting this, why should one fish be singled out by the epithet when
the whole “herd or shoal” is equally ἱερός? The infrequent coupling of the
adjective with ἰχθὺς suggests some less general meaning, if it mean anything.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>Athenæus<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
after trying to answer, “But what is the fish which is called Sacred?”
by citing instances where the Dolphin, Pompilus, Chrysophrys, etc., are
so designated, adds a sentence which seems either to be the authority
for, or to confirm the authority of Faesi; “but some understand by the
term ‘sacred fish’ one let go and dedicated to the God, just as people
give the same name to a consecrated ox.”</p>

<p>Seymour holds that “the epithet ἱερὸς as applied to a fish in <i>Il.</i>,
XVI. 407, has not been satisfactorily explained from ordinary Greek
usage: instead of sacred, it seems rather to mean active, vigorous,
strong. Cf. the same epithet applied to the picket guard of the
Achæans in <i>Il.</i>, X. 56.” Curtius connects the word with the Sanskrit
ishirá = vigorous. Ἱερὸς as active, agile, strong is applied to
horses, spies, mind, women, and cows.</p>

<p>Leaf suggests that the word, when applied to night, etc., would have
developed the meaning of <i>mighty</i>, <i>mysterious</i>, and so later on
<i>sacred</i>. If <i>sacred</i>, the epithet may have arisen out of some sort
of <i>tabu</i> or religious feeling against eating fish, in early times
often regarded as either uncanny creatures living under water and
possessed of superhuman powers, or as divine or semi-divine.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Gradually the dread of fish as creatures <i>tabu</i> wore off, but
survived for long in a hole-and-corner way, <i>e.g.</i> the veneration of
τέττιξ ἐνάλιος, ‘the lobster,’ at Seriphos,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
or the deification of καρκίνοι, ‘crabs,’ in Lemnos.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>If ἱερὸς does mean a big, fine, vigorous fish, to most modern
fishermen a Rod would seem implied. This is strengthened by the
nature of the act to which the simile applies: ὣς ἕλκε δουρὶ φαεινῷ,
as Patroclus dragged Thestor on the bright spear from the chariot, so
the fishermen dragged the fish from the sea.</p>

<p>In D. the case, if any, for the implied use of the <i>Rod</i> is very
weak. In this alone of all the references does lead as a weight
occur. Here we have no comparison to action such as dragging up a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
fine fish, but simply to swiftness; the effect of it, the splash,
makes the point of the comparison with which Iris sped on her
mission. Nor does the adjective applied to the fish give any aid, for
ὠμηστής, if it be not redundant, signifies ‘<i>raw-flesh devouring</i>’
(rather than ‘<i>ravenous</i>’) fish, such as shark or
swordfish.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>But if the early Greeks and Romans only fished for the pot and not
for amusement, the question arises, why should this particular
Homeric <i>piscator</i> “be after” swordfish or shark? Fishing, down to
the early Roman times, continued to be more of a distinct trade than
was the pursuit of animals and birds.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
Hence the Net with quicker and surer returns and not the Rod was the
favourite weapon of the fishermen by trade.</p>

<p>In F. (<i>Od.</i>, IV. 369, and XII. 330) something in the nature of a
line and of a bait of some sort (though not necessarily of a rod)
attached to the bent, or barbed, hooks, must be implied. Hunger would
assuredly continue to “gnaw at their bellies,” if their only food was
caught by hooks, pure and simple, for, as Juliana Berners pithily
puts it, “Ye can not brynge an hoke into a fyssh mouth without a
bayte.”</p>

<p>Abstention from fish, however general, did not prevail among Homer’s
sailors. Athenæus (I. 22) points out that since the hooks used could
not have been forged on the Island, and so must have been carried on
board the ships, “it is plain sailors were fond of and skilful in
catching fish.”</p>

<p>Basing my surmise on ὄρνιθας in <i>Od.</i>, XII. 331 and on the statement
of Eustathius <i>ad loc.</i>, that hooks were used for capturing
<i>sea-birds</i> as well as fish, I suggest that the baits on the hooks
were either small fishes (left possibly by the tide in some pool in
the rocks), or shellfish, or oysters. These attached to a line (with
or without a rod) and thrown into the sea were taken by both sea-fowl
and fish.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
But all the preceding points dwarf in interest before the term κέρας
βοὸς ἀγραύλοιο, “the horn of a field ox, or ox of the homestead.”<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
How does the horn of an ox find itself in this galley? What was its
exact use? Where and how was it employed?</p>

<p>Many scholars and fishermen, ancient and modern, have essayed the
problem. The reason for the use of the horn passed early out of common
knowledge and afforded matter for conjecture from Aristotle downwards.</p>

<p>To enumerate all the theories would necessitate a list almost as long
as Homer’s catalogue of the ships. The following, the most important,
must suffice for our purpose.</p>

<p>(1) Κέρας was a little pipe or collar of horn protecting the line
(which passed through it) just at its junction with the hook, and
served the same purpose as a “gimp” on a trolling line.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
“This precaution (according to Arnold) was taken so that the fish might not
gnaw through the line”—a precaution very similar to our use of wire
between the line and the hook, when fishing for tigerfish, tarpon,
shark, etc.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>A similar interpretation of the word occurred to Aristotle, who<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
held that the lower piece of the line was fortified by a little
hollow piece of horn, lest the fish should come at the line itself
and bite it off. But the use of κέρας in the second (<i>Od.</i>) passage
appears to rule out Aristotle’s and Arnold’s interpretations. The
fish here are admittedly, not <i>raw-flesh devouring</i>, which might
imply size, but <i>small</i>. Why then this elaborate contrivance as
precaution against severance of the line?</p>

<p>The above explanation of the use of κέρας derives strong support from
the method even now employed in the Nile.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
The native sportsman, as protection against its being bitten off,
covers a soft woollen line, to which is tethered a live rat, a common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
bait for a big Nile fish, with a pipe or tube of maize stalk. Here
the similarity ends; on the Nile no hook is employed; the sportsman
harpoons the fish while hanging on to the rat.</p>

<p>(2) Κέρας, according to Paley (quoting Spitzner), was a bit of horn
fastened to the hook and plummet to disguise their appearance; this,
from being nearly the same colour as the sea, served better to
deceive the fish.</p>

<p>(3) Κέρας, according to Trollope and others, was the horn or tube,
but in it only the leaden weight was enclosed.</p>

<p>(4) Κέρας was a kind of tress, made out of the hair of a bull.
Plutarch, however, states flatly, “But this is an error.” Damm and
others insist that the word in this sense is post-Homeric, and agree
with Plutarch that these tresses, if ever used, would have been of
the hair of a horse, and not of a bull.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>(5) Κέρας, according to Hayman and others, was simply a prong of horn
attached to a staff to pierce and fork out the fish while feeding;
hence the preliminary baits, εἴδατα (similar to baiting a swim on the
Thames), are of course not on or attached to the horn.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>The epithet in C. is περιμήκης, not merely long, but very long. The
adjective, if not redundant, lends weight to Hayman’s theory of spear
as against fishing rod. Against it, however, in <i>Od.</i>, X. 293, the
ῥάβδος, or wand of Circe, which thrice appears (in <i>Od.</i>, X. 238,
319, 389) minus any adjective, suddenly takes unto itself περιμήκης,
very long, without apparent reason for the distinction.</p>

<p>(6) Mr. Minchin’s explanation is ingenious, if open to two
objections. “As to the ox horn puzzle,” he writes to me, “I feel no
doubt that the Cherithai (as the Bible calls the Kretans) cut a ring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
out of the horn of an ox, and then cut a gap, thus making a crescent
of horn, to the one end of which they attached their line, which is
exactly what the black fellows (in Australia) do to-day with a pearl
shell.”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>But against this conjecture weighs the fact that as the grain of the
horn runs from butt to point, if the hook be cut from cross-section
it would probably break, as the cross-section would be across the
grain, and so very frayable. If, however, the hook were cut from a
panel removed from the side of the horn and just where the curve
comes before the point, the substance of the hook might possibly stand.</p>

   <p class="f120">MR. MINCHIN’S EXPLANATION OF <b>κέρας</b>.</p>
</div>

<p class="space-above1">Anticipating and dissenting from Mr. Minchin’s
explanation are Monro’s note on <i>Il.</i>, XXIV. 80 ff., and Professor
Tylor’s comment in the note. “The main difficulty in the ancient
explanation of the passage is the prominence given to the κέρας, which
is spoken of as if <i>it</i> were the chief feature of the fisherman’s
apparatus. The question naturally suggests whether the κέρας might not
be <i>the hook itself</i>, made, like so many utensils of primitive times,
from the horn of an animal.”</p>

<p>On this point Mr. E. B. Tylor writes to Monro as follows: “Fish-hooks
of <i>horn</i> are in fact known in prehistoric Europe, but are scarce,
and very clumsy. After looking into the matter, I am disposed to
think that the Scholiast knew what he was about, and that the old
Greeks really used a horn guard, where the modern pike fisher only
has his line bound, to prevent the fish biting through. Such a horn
guard, if used then, would last on in use, anglers being highly
conservative, and I shall look out for it.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Maspero,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
however, states, “Objects in bone and horn are still among the rarities
of our museums: horn is perishable and is eagerly devoured by certain
insects, which rapidly destroy it,” with which statement may be
compared <i>Od.</i>, XXI. 395, “lest the worms might have eaten the horns”
(of the bow of Odysseus).</p>

<p>Finally the explanation first suggested by Mr. C. E. Haskins<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
and adopted by Dr. Leaf, that κέρας was an artificial <i>bait</i> of horn,
appears to me as an angler and as having seen in the Pacific, but not
used, “bait fish-hooks made of shell all in one piece, of a simple
hooked form without any barb,”<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
to be perhaps the most likely solution of our problem.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Haskins, κέρας means an artificial bait of horn,
probably shaped like a small fish, and hollow at all events at the
upper end, into which a μολύβδαινα (lead) was inserted to sink it. It
had hooks of χαλκός fastened to it and was used by being thrown out,
allowed to sink, and then rapidly drawn through the water to attract
the fish by its glitter and motion. The εἴδατα may either be the same
as the κέρας mentioned in the next line, or more probably ground bait
thrown in to attract fish to the spot, while the use of the present
participle, κατὰ ... βάλλων, seems to imply constant action, <i>i.e.</i>
the fisherman throwing in at intervals a handful of ground bait.</p>

<p>While I have not, like Mr. Haskins, “caught many trout with artificial
baits made of horn,” I can vouch that in England horn minnows still
exist and that horn spoons are even now used for pike.</p>

<p>We find in Homer no special variety of fishes, except eels and
dolphins. Eels are not ranked in a strict sense as fish; the words are
“both eels and fishes” (<i>Il.</i>, XXI. 203, 353). Sea calves and seals
also find a place. Other fish occur in the picture of Scylla (<i>Od.</i>,
XII. 95): “and there she fishes (ἰχθυάᾳ) swooping round the rock, for
dolphins or sea-dogs, or whatso greater beast she may anywhere take,
whereof the deep-voiced Amphitrite feeds countless flocks.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Seals<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
greedily devour a corpse in the sea (<i>Od.</i>, XV. 480). <i>Il.</i>, XXI. 122,
203, extend the pleasant practice to fish and eels: “around him eels
and fishes swarmed, tearing and gnawing the fat about his kidneys.”</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that in Greek and Latin literature the first fish
attaining to the dignity of a <i>name</i> is the Eel.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>The sea is called ἰχθυόεις, “fishy,” or perhaps better “fishful,”
twelve times: the Hellespont only once. Plutarch (<i>Symp.</i>, IV. 4) had
this probably in mind, when he wrote, “the heroes encamped by the
Hellespont used themselves to a spare diet, banishing from their tables
all superfluous delicacies to such a degree that they abstained from
fish.” Ἰχθυόεις happens but once in connection with a river, the Hyllus
(<i>Il.</i>, XX. 392).</p>

<p>Homer seemingly applies it only where he is impressed, not by the
number of fish obvious to the eye or still remaining in, but by the
number already taken out of the water. The proportion of salt water
‘fishfuls’ to fresh water ‘fishfuls’—13 as against 1—would, if not
quite accidental, accord with the fact that the early Greeks, whatever
be the time at which they became Ichthyophagists, set no high store on
fresh-water fish.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">THE CONTEST BETWEEN HOMER AND HESIOD—HOMER’S DEATH</span></h3></div>

<p>The cause and circumstances of Homer’s death remain uncertain and
disputed. For them some writers hold fisherfolk responsible.</p>

<p>Midway between (A) the tradition that Homer took so to heart his
impotency to read—be it remembered he had been acclaimed “of mortals
far the wisest”—the riddle of the fisher boys, that he took also to
bed and shortly after died, and (B) the absolute assertion by Herodotus
the Grammarian (<i>Vita Homeri</i>) that the poet “died at Ios of disease
contracted on his arrival there, and not of grief at failing to
understand the riddle of the fishers,” lies the account of the death
given in the Ἀγὼν Ἡσιόδου καὶ Ὁμήρου, or <i>The Contest between Hesiod
and Homer</i>.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p><i>The Contest</i>, despite the rather laboured thrusts of the antagonists
full of curious if not connected touches, makes the funeral solemnities
of King Amphidamas the occasion and Chalcis (not Aulis or Delos) the
scene of the encounter.</p>

<p>Victory and prize were adjudged to Hesiod, because he “sang of Tilth
and Peace, not of War and Gore.”<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
If left to a jury composed of or even leavened by fishers instead of
to the king, the verdict would surely have gone the other way, were it
only on the ground that while Homer affords several spirited pictures
of fishing, we search in vain all Hesiod’s genuine works for any
mention, for even any allusion to fishing.</p>

<p>The word <i>fish</i> occurs only in <i>Works and Days</i>, line 277. Even if we
allow <i>The Shield of Heracles</i> to be by Hesiod, we find but one passage
(lines 214-5) relating to fishing, and this with a Net.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
Hesiod’s silence on the subject surprises, for (<i>a</i>) he boasts himself
the poet of country life, (<i>b</i>) states that as a youth he fed and led
his flocks on the sides and amid the streams of Mount Helicon, and
(<i>c</i>) passed the rest of his life on the banks of the river
Cephissus.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>Homer had previously, on consulting the Pythian Priestess as to the
country whence he sprang, received a response, which I render—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>But now let the Ἀγὼν speak. “After the contest the poet sailed unto
Ios, and there abode a long time, being already an old man. Sitting one
day on the sea-shore, he asked some lads returning from fishing,</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Homer, however, caught not on, until he was told that the key of ‘what’
was not fish, but lice.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>“Remembering him of the oracle that the end of life was upon him, he
makes the epitaph for his own tomb. Arising thence, he slipped in the
mud, falling on his rib, and on the third day, so men say, died. And he

</div></div></div>

<p>The story of Hesiod after his victory over Homer as set forth in <i>The
Contest</i> repays telling.</p>

<p>He journeyed at once to Delphi to give the first fruits of his victory
as a votive offering to the Oracle—and here let us note how in early
times, certainly down to the time of Xenophon, the Greeks at important
events in their lives resorted to some such fane for guidance.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

Greeted from the inner shrine as one “held in honour high by the
immortal Muses,” as one “whose fame shall reach as far as is spread the
light of morn” (this use of one of Homer’s own and fairest lines<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
was no doubt intended as the highest possible tribute to his victor),
Hesiod is then warned, “But beware of the fair grove of the Nemean
Zeus, for there lies thy fate of death.”</p>

<p>Alas! for the poet, who to escape the well-known temple of Nemean Zeus
in the Peloponnese hurried off to stay at Oinoë in Locris, never to
discover that there too was a place sacred to the same god and called
by the same name.</p>

<p>At Oinoë he abode with his hosts, until suspecting that he had
debauched their sister (Hesiod seems to have been endowed with
superhuman powers, for according to Proclus and Suidas he was a youth
twice!), they slew him and threw him into the sea. But on the third day
his body was borne back to land by dolphins. On hue and cry for the
murderers being raised the brothers seized a fishing boat and set sail
for Crete.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
But they found not favour in the “pure eyes and perfect witness of
all-judging” Zeus, who thundered and sank them. “But the maiden,
their sister, after the rape hanged herself.” To conclude in the
words of the Ἀγών,</p>

<p>The <i>Shield of Heracles</i>, now rarely attributed to Hesiod the poet
nearest in time to Homer, gives us pictures, similar if more ornate in
style to those in Homer’s “The Shield of Achilles.”</p>

<p><i>The Shield of Heracles</i> would probably not have been written had not
Homer’s “Shield of Achilles” existed. It differs from the older poem in

<p>The painting of the harbour, of the cliffs, of the fishes tossing in

<p>The occurrence here of the Dolphin, together with the part that it
played in the recovery of Hesiod’s body, makes this an appropriate
place for a brief <i>résumé</i> of the position occupied by this fish in
Greek and Roman authors, and of the many pretty legends in which for
all time its memory is enshrined.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>The myth of the Dolphin—a creature of lightness and swiftness—as the
<i>protégé</i> of the gods and the helpmate of man stands out as a purely
Hellenic conception, and contrasts sharply with that of the Tortoise,
unmoving, half-hidden, which according to Eastern belief supports the
weight of the world.</p>

<p>In Greek and Latin literature (exclusive of the recipes of the gourmets
or the rhapsodies of the opsophagi) no fish wins more frequent mention
or higher appreciation than the Dolphin.</p>

<p>And justly so, since, of a nature essentially philanthropic, it
delights to be with man, and aid man by willing services.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
Pliny,indeed, confesses that he could never reach the end of the stories
about their kindly acts, especially towards the young. He notes that
they found pleasure not only in the society of man, but also in music,
<i>præcipue hydrauli sono</i>, or “the organ,” the only trait, I imagine,
common to the fish and to Nero!<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

The helpfulness of the Dolphin shows itself in diverse ways, often
on vital occasions. In gratitude for the rescue of Telemachus,
Ulysses wore its effigy stamped on signet and on shield. Attracted
by Arion’s singing, it saves from the waves “the sweet musician,”
and bears him safe to Tænarum.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
Later on, with pleasant disregard of religious bias, it rescues
the Christian Saint Callistratus from a watery grave.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
It acts as willing, almost as “common” carrier, alike to
gods, schoolboys, and damsels in distress. It anticipates our
meteorological office, for from the direction of its swim can be
predicted the wind of to-morrow.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>Its constant and practical service to fishermen meets wide attestation.
Oppian sings it: Pliny proses it: Ælian cribs, and confirms it.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>From the lagoon of Latera (says our Latin author) multitudes of mugils
or grey mullets at stated periods flock to the sea.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
The moment the migration begins, crowds collect for the sport, shout
their loudest, and summon “Simo” from the vasty deep, or rather the
mouth of the lagoon.</p>

<p>The Dolphins, formed in line of battle, swim swiftly in, cut off
all escape to sea, and drive before them the frightened fish to the
shoals.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
While the nets are being drawn the dolphins kill, but pause not to
eat, such fish as escape the meshes. When at last the catch is saved,
then they fall to and devour the fish already killed.

<p>Here let us note an instance of intellectual anticipation of Trade
Unionism. Well aware that their labour has yielded far more than the
regulation Trade stroke, and earned more than the Eight Hours’ wage,
they quietly await settling day—next morning—when they are paid
by being stuffed not only with fish, but also with crumbs soaked in
wine.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>Thus Oppian of another fish-drive,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“The Fishers pick the choicest of the Spoil,</span>
<span class="i4">Supply their wishes and reward their Toil.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In a story of similar fishing by Mucianus the Dolphins await neither
summons by voice as above, or signal by torch (as in Ælian, II. 8) but
“uncalled and of their own accord” present themselves ready for work.</p>

<p>Trades Unionism among the Dolphins is again not obscurely indicated,
<i>ipsis quoque inter se publica est societas</i>. Furthermore, close
corporations, not unlike mediæval Guilds or modern Unions, but wotting
not of “blackleg” or even “dilutee,” surely prevailed, for <i>suum quæque
cymba e delphinis socium habet</i>.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>Ælian’s dolphins foreshadow, it would seem, our modern principle of
co-operation, when “they draw near demanding the due reward of their
joint-undertaking.” But their organisation of labour differed from ours
in two respects.</p>

<p>First, the willingness and the wage for night and day shift were
identical. Second, since they were not blessed as we in the higher
civilisation of the twentieth century are by the exalted, if not always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
successful conceptions of Conferences of Conciliation or Compulsory
Arbitration, a strike, occasioned either by divergence from the strict
terms of the bargain, or by gauche “handling” of the workers—whether
for it the sanction of the Ballot or an order of the Shop Steward were
a necessary preliminary my researches have not as yet disclosed—a
strike, I repeat, could not be called off, but was irreparable, for
οὐκέτι oἱ δελφῖνες ἀρηγόνες εἰσὶν ἐπ’ ἄγρην.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>By the Dolphins the economic weapon was evidently brought to greater
perfection than by their human brethren. The crude “down tooling”
of the Egyptian masons in the fourteenth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
although accompanied by violence such as forcing main gates, etc., was
(according to Maspero) quickly settled by the attacked Governor handing
over the keys of the granaries, whence with bags—and bellies—full
filled they meekly returned to work.</p>

<p>Of another ingratiating characteristic of the Dolphin, its attachment
and services to boys, instances are numerous and well attested.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
In truth we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
from the autoptic gospel of the Anti-Semite Apion<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>

that I can draw attention to two stories only. These illustrate the
relations existing between the Dolphin, and (<i>a</i>) the boy of Baiæ as
set forth by Pliny (IX. 8), and (<i>b</i>) the boy of Iasos by Oppian (V.
468), Athenæus (XIII. 85), and Ælian (VI. 15).<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>In the last two occurs the pretty tale of the fish waiting daily till
school ended to take the beloved lad for swims and larks in the sea,
but without the refinement found elsewhere of waiting every morning and
afternoon to carry him to and from school! To the spectacle in Iasian
waters of their play and of their races (“to bring the thorough-bred
and the donkey together” à la Admiral Rous, the fish must have been
crushingly handicapped!):</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Drawn by Report to see the strange Amour</span>
<span class="i4">Admiring Nations crowded to the Shore.</span>
<span class="i4">Rapt with delight, surveyed their am’rous Game</span>
<span class="i4">And owned the Sight superior to the Fame.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But alas! soon was “their am’rous Game” to end.</p>

<p>One day the lad, tired and eager for a bathe, threw himself on his
comrade’s back, only however to impale himself on the dorsal spike and
gradually bleed to death. No sooner did the Dolphin perceive the water
tinged with blood, than “with the force of a full-sailed Rhodian ship,”
he drave straight for land, flung himself and his burden high and dry
on the strand, and there, by the side of his beloved dead, abode until
death came unto him also.</p>

<p>To testify that these twain “were lovely and pleasant in their lives,
and in their death they were not divided,” the citizens of Iasos
erected a monument, showing the beautiful boy astride the back of the
Dolphin, and issued coins bearing the effigies of each, which were
sought far as souvenirs by bands of pilgrims attracted thither by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
story. In such regard did the legend continue to be held that even up
to the third century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the Iasians struck coins with the
device of a youth swimming beside a dolphin, which he clasps with one
arm.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>Like Scylla, who “fishes for dolphins and whatso greater beast she
may anywhere take,” both the Thracians and Byzantines, despite the
enormous annual revenues derived by the latter from their fisheries,
caught and ate the Dolphin, and for so-doing are branded as impious and
barbarian.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>

<p>The ancient literature of the East also portrays Dolphins (<i>Ç i

ships, etc.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
The inhabitants of Isle Sainte Marie, near Madagascar, even now never
harm or eat the fish, holding it as sacred, because they believe it
rendered signal service to some ancestor.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>Herodotus mentions a tribe living round Lake Prasias, who in dwellings and
food resemble the Wolga folk, and early Continental and English Lake-dwellers:—
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>“Platforms supplied by tall piles stand in the middle of the lake,
which are approached from the land by a narrow single stage. At first
the piles were fixed by all citizens, but since that time the custom
that has prevailed about fixing them is this, every man drives in three
for each wife he marries. Now the men all have many wives apiece, and
this is the way they live. Each has his own hut (wherein he dwells) on
one of the platforms, and each has a trap door, giving access to the
lake beneath: their wont is to tie the baby children by the foot with
a string, to save them from rolling into the water. They feed their
horses and other beasts on fish, which abound in the lake in such a
degree that a man has only to open his trap door, and let down a basket
by a rope into the water, and then wait a very short time, when he
draws it up quite full of fish.”<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Confirming and illustrating Herodotus’s account (I. 202) of how a tribe
dwelling on the Araxes lived on raw fish,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
but depicting more sharply how on fish a whole people were dependent
for everything that made up their lives, comes Arrian’s
description<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
of the Ichthyophagi of the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>Denied by the barrenness of their country the ordinary sources of
subsistence, they were compelled to use fish for every purpose—food,
clothes, houses, etc. These peoples (for the Indian Ichthyophagi are
quite distinct from the Arabian) find comment by many authors—<i>e.g.</i>
Strabo, Pausanias, Diodorus Siculus. Although by their diet of fish
comparatively free from disease, they were noted as short-lived.
Alexander the Great, with a view to increasing their span of existence,
forbade <i>all</i> the Ichthyophagi an unmixed diet.</p>

<p>Solinus (56, 9) testifies as to their extreme swiftness in swimming:
<i>non secus quam marinæ beluæ nando in mari valent</i>. Marco Polo (III.
41) found on the coast of Arabia an interesting survival of the
Ichthyophagi. In consequence of the sterility of the soil they fed
their cattle, camels, and horses on dried fish, “which being regularly
served to them they eat without any signs of dislike. They are dried
and stored, and the beasts feed on them from year’s end to year’s end.
The cattle will also eat these fish just out of the water.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>Not dissimilar is the account given<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
some twelve centuries earlier of the people of Stobera in India.
“They clothe themselves in the skins of very large fishes, and their
cattle taste like fish and eat extraordinary things: for they are fed
upon fish, just as in Cairo the flocks are fed on figs.”</p>

<p>In strong contrast with these Ichthyophagi other races
abstained entirely, not as the Egyptians and Jews partially,
from fish. Of such were the Syrians, either because they worshipped
fish as gods or held them as sacred,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
or because (as asserted by Anaximander) of the inhumanity, since
mankind originally were born from fish, of devouring one’s fathers and
mothers.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>Surprising, indeed, sounds the statement of Plutarch that among total
abstainers in early times were the more religious-minded of the Greeks,
among whom later the eating of fish developed into a passionate, almost
cat-like, devotion. Invested though the abstentions, total or other,
were with divine origin or armed with divine sanction, the root reason
of all of them rested, I believe, on the terror of skin-diseases,
attributable to a fish diet.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
Others, however, hold that the ultimate reason of the <i>tabu</i> lay in
the uncanny nature of creatures that can and do live under water, while we can not.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Fishermen rank higher in the time of Herodotus than in the Homeric era.
Even the oracles and soothsayers now condescend to avail themselves of
their technique and parlance for framing their answers. Thus Amphilytus
the Acarnanian encourages Pisistratus before the battle of Pallene with</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“The casting net is thrown down, and the fishing net spread wide.</span>
<span class="i4">And the tunnies shall dart to and fro (therein) in the moonlight.”<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>If Pisistratus squared the Acarnanian, as effectively as the Alcmæonidæ
(his hereditary foes and the ejectors of his descendants from Athens)
absolutely bought the oracle at Delphi, words of greater light and
leading than “The Tunnies shall dart to and fro in the moonlight” might
have been vouchsafed, for Herodotus relates that Pisistratus fell
on the enemy, when they were having their <i>mid-day</i> meal, or asleep
after it, or playing dice. To suppose that these words foretold and
were understood by Pisistratus to foretell the hour of the subsequent
capture of Athens itself presumes a power of mental suggestion, which
even Charcot would have envied.</p>

<p>The deliverance may possibly have been particular as regards time, but
more probably was, oracle-like, entirely general in terms and time.
The words “And the tunnies shall dart up and down in the moonlight”
merely continue the fishing analogy of the first line, and refer to the
well-known method of catching Tunnies “at the full of the moon,” when,
allured by the silvery light, they glide and race through the water,
and are easily taken.</p>

<p>The mention here of the Tunny makes appropriate some notice of a fish,
which looms large in nearly all our authors. Most of them dilate at
length on its multitude, migrations, habits, and size. Its economic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
value as a food asset, then and now, finds ample recognition by writers
separated over two thousand years (such as Aristotle and Apostolides),
and in its current title of “The Manna of the Mediterranean.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is curious that the first two fish, the Dolphin and Tunny, on which
I have occasion to comment because of the chronological sequence of
Hesiod and Herodotus, should have greater attention paid them and
should occupy more space in ancient writers than any other.</p>

<p>The reasons, however, are very dissimilar.</p>

<p>The Dolphin by its engaging habits of aidfulness and of comradeship—to
it scarcely anything human seems alien—evoked gratitude and liking.
The Tunny, apart from the wonder awakened by its multitudes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
migrations, compelled an economic interest from its food-producing
quantities and qualities. Rhode has excellently summarised the
dissemblance: “<i>Delphinus veterum cordibus atque animis se insinuavit,
thynnus gulis atque ventriculis.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>The annual campaign of the Tunny fishing, lasting from May 15 to Oct.
25, was based on a regular and thorough organisation. All the boats
of a given section of the coast acted under the orders of an elected
Captain, whose word was law.</p>

<p>Descriptions of fishing for Tunny and Pelamyde—the name given to
the young Tunny from his habit of burying himself in the mud (πήλῳ
μύειν),<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
a derivation often attributed to Aristotle, see <i>H. A.</i>, VIII. 15, or
of herding together (πέλειν ἅμα) according to Plutarch—may be found
in Aristotle, <i>N. H.</i>, IV. 10, and VIII. 15, in Pliny, <i>H. N.</i>, IX.
53, in Ælian, <i>de nat. an.</i>, XV. 5 and 6, and in Oppian, <i>hal.</i>, IV.
531 ff. The story by the last of the Thracians piercing and taking
myriads of mutilated Pelamydes from the mud, in which they have for warmth
ensconced themselves, merits reading if only for his indignant burst:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“The various Tortures of the bleeding Shoal</span>
<span class="i4">Command a Pity from the stoutest Soul.”<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Aristophanes (<i>Hipp.</i>, 313) compares Cleon to the watch posted on a
cliff or height to signal the advent of the Tunnies, a position (as
Theocritus [III. 26] and Oppian [<i>hal.</i>, IV. 637] show), very similar
to that of the “Hooer” in the pilchard fishery of Cornwall at the present day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>These look-outs were frequently artificial. Ælian, <i>de nat. an.</i>, XV.
5, describes a scaffolding consisting of two fir trees between which
many cross pieces were fastened. The long ladders still used in Austria
and Italy (of which Keller gives an illustration<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>)
and the Turkish <i>dalian</i> of the Bosporus represent the modern
scaffold. Oppian (<i>hal.</i>, III. 630 ff.) and Ælian (<i>de nat. an.</i>, XV.
5) note the enormous hauls made by the fishermen when “the army” of
the Tunnies set out on its migrations, company by company.</p>

<p>The nets used for the capture of Tunny by the Italians (at the present
day) are fixed: made of thick cord, without leads, and sometimes as
much as 250 fathoms long, and 15 fathoms deep, thus recalling Oppian’s
“a Town of Nets.”<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
Special regard has to be paid now as of old, in fixing their
position, to the course frequented by this eminently migratory genus
in its annual passage from the Atlantic to the Black Sea and Sea of
Azov, a distance of 2800 miles and back again. The same route is
always travelled by an ever living stream of undiminished fulness,
furnishing food to millions on the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>To the Phœnicians and to the Spaniards of old the Tunny ranked high
as a commercial asset. The Tyrian tunny was specially prized<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>;
its <i>salsamentum</i> travelled far and wide. Rhode (p. 38) points out,
however, that this originally was designed not as a delicacy, but as
a preventive against scurvy and other diseases attendant on the long
voyages which the far-flung commerce of the Phœnicians demanded.</p>

<p>The older port, Sidon, got its name from its wealth of fish, which
in Phœnician was called <i>Sidon</i>,<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
while Tyrus, one of the earliest inhabitants of the younger port,
traditionally invented fishing tackle.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
Many Spanish towns, as their coins attest, notably those of Gades
and Carteia, owed much of their prosperity, if not their existence,
to the salt or pickled fish trade. Tunny fishing still remains a lucrative
industry in the Peninsula.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Pliny bears witness to the full stream of Tunny in IX. 2, where he
tells us the multitude of the fish which met the fleet of Alexander
the Great under the command of Nearchus on one occasion was so vast,
that only by advancing in battle line, as on an enemy, was he able
to cut his way through: <i>non voce, non sonitu, non ictu, sed fragore
terrentur, nec nisi ruina turbantur</i>.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Faber’s account of the watchman, of the alarm caused by throwing in
stones near the inlet through which the shoal of fish has just passed,
of the raising of the hue and cry to drive it towards the end of the
enclosure, the battering of the fish to death with oars, and of other
devices might well pass, although written in the nineteenth century,
for a description of the Tunny fishing by an author of the first century.</p>

<p>From this fishing Æschylus<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
drew his vivid image of the destruction of the host of Xerxes at
sea—an image placed with more poetic than dramatic aptness in the
mouth of the Persian messenger who paints the battle to Atossa. “But
the Greeks,” he tells her, “kept striking, hacking us with fragments of
oars and splinters of wrecks, <i>as if we were Tunnies or a draft of fish</i>.”</p>

<p>The comparison strikes as all the more telling, when we remember that
one of the most killing methods of capturing the Tunny was and still
is by stabbing with pikes and poles the fish, after having driven them
into a narrow space.</p>

<p>Imagine the storm of applause, which that bold and glowing picture (in
but two lines!) of the common practice and of the wondrous victory must
have aroused from an audience who eight years before had either fought
at or feared for Salamis, to an author whose conspicuous gallantry both
there and at Marathon had earned for him the high honour of a place in
the great commemorative fresco in the Stoa Poikile at Athens!

solstices that he teaches even men themselves without the help of
any astrological table.”<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
Further, that being dim sighted, or as according to Æschylus “casting
a squint-eye like a Tunny,” the fish always coast the Euxine Sea
on the right side and contrariwise when they come forth—“prudently
committing the care of their bodies to their best eye!”</p>

<p>Again, although the fish lack knowledge of arithmetic, they are yet so
endowed that “they arrive in such a manner to the perfection of that
science,” that for mutual love and protection “they always make up
their whole fry into the form of a cube and make a solid of the whole
number consisting of six equal planes, and swim in such order as to
present an equal front in each direction.”</p>

<p>“The Tunny more than any other fish delights in the heat of the sun. It
will burrow for warmth in the sand in shallow waters near the shore, or
will, because it is warm, disport itself on the surface of the sea.”<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
With this pleasure inevitably <i>surgit aliquid amari</i>, for about the
rising of the Dog-star this fish, as well as the sword fish, became the
prey of a piercing parasite, which was nicknamed the “gadfly.”</p>

<p>The ordinary weights and sizes to which the Tunny attained are
uncertain. The passages in Arist., <i>N. H.</i>, VIII. 30, and in Pliny, IX.
17, on account of the doubt whether the span of tail should be two or
five cubits are not authoritative. Richter records the capture in 1565
of a fish thirty-two feet long and sixteen feet thick, on whose skin a
ship of war was depicted in its entirety.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>The power of the skin to expand seems the only limitation of their size

TO DISCOVER THAT IN THE MUREX ITS YEARLY GROWTH IS INDICATED BY THE
SHELL—SENSES OF FISH: EXPERIMENTS AS TO HEARING</p>
</div>

<p class="center">“Aristotle hath his Oare in every Water”</p>

<p>If the passage quoted in my Introduction left any doubt that Plato was
no admirer of fishing or fishermen, the following, from <i>The Laws</i>,
VII. 823 (Jowett’s translation), is conclusive proof.</p>

<p>“And, now, let us address young men in the form of a prayer for their
welfare: O Friends, may no desire of hunting in the sea, or of catching
the creatures in the waters, ever take possession of you, either when
you are awake, or when you are asleep, by hooks, with weels, which
latter is a very lazy contrivance, and let no desire of catching men,
or piracy by sea, enter into your souls.”</p>

<p>Then Plato adds: “Only the best of hunting is allowed at all, which
is carried on by men with horses, dogs, and men’s own persons,” and
is really hard exercise. “Fishing is not an occupation worthy of a
man well born or well brought up, because it demands more of address
and ruse than force, and is not for young people, like hunting, the
occasion of healthy exercise.”<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
When expressing astonishment at the variety and extent of Aristotle’s
knowledge, one of the characters of Athenæus asks from what Proteus
or Nereus he could have found out all he writes about fishes and
other animals.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
The curiosity of the questioner was natural. It is, however, probable
that Aristotle, from living for several years close to the sea and
from his intercourse with fishermen, had amassed a big fund of
information about fishes and other aquatic animals.</p>

<p>His knowledge of the Mediterranean fishes not only exceeded that of
any ancient writer, but also, if Belon, Rondolet, and Salviani be
excepted, that of any writer before Risso and Cuvier. However true may
be the criticism of Dr. Günther that Aristotle’s “ideas of specific
distinction were as vague as those of the fishermen whose nomenclature
he adopted,” the fact cannot be gainsaid that Aristotle was, and
remains, a very great Naturalist as well as a very great Biologist.</p>

<p>To him<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
by right belongs the distinction, which (except incidentally
in Mr. Lones’ work<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>)
I have so far failed to find attributed to him, of being the first
writer to note, certainly the first to point out, that its scales
make possible a shrewd, in the case of the <i>murex</i> an exact,
computation of the age of a fish.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>If from lack of the microscope he did not in all particulars antedate,
he certainly blazed the trail for the discovery of scale-reading at
the close of the eighteenth century by the Dutch microscopist van
Leeuwenhoek<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
and its rediscovery as regards the carp in 1899 by
Hoffbauer,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
the <i>Gadidæ</i> and <i>Pleuronectidæ</i> in 1900-03 by J. Stuart
Thomson,<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
and the <i>Salmonidæ</i> about 1904 by H. W. Johnston and
others.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>He tells us in <i>The Natural History</i>, I. 1, that “what the feather is
in a bird, the scale is in a fish”; in III. 11,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
that “the scales of fish become harder and thicker, and in those
which are wasting or aging, become still harder”; in VIII. 30, that
“the old fish are distinguishable by the <i>size</i>” (note this!) “and
the hardness of their scales.”<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>He then buttresses this discovery of annual growth of scale by another
fact resulting from his observation that “the <i>Murex</i> lives for about
six years, and the yearly increase is indicated by a distinct interval
in the spiral convolution of the shell,”<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
or as Bohn renders the words, “its annual increase is seen in the divisions on the helix of its shell.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>In Leeuwenhoek we read that, in the examination by a rough self-made
microscope of the scales of a large tame carp, he counted the component
<i>scale-layers</i> lying one above the other, “as if glued together,”
and found without exception that a new layer larger than the one
of the preceding year is added. The carp, accidentally killed when
forty years old, possessed forty such layers in each scale. He adds
pathetically—anticipating perhaps Lytton’s—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“A Reformer, a creed by posterity learnt</span>
<span class="i4">A century after its author is burnt”—</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>that “many people accused me of telling lies on the
matter!”<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>One cannot help being struck with acute astonishment that for over
the 2000 years between Aristotle and Leeuwenhoek we obtain, with the
exception<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
of nine words in Pliny (IX. 33), <i>Senectutis indicium
squamarum duritia, quæ non sunt omnibus similes</i>, cribbed and
condensed, as was often his wont, from Aristotle, little, if any,
addition to our knowledge of scale-reading.</p>

<p>The ancient authors either ignore or are ignorant of it. Nowhere, not
even in that close observer Oppian, that omnivorous reader Athenæus,
that pleasant purloiner Ælian, do we read a single line on the subject.
But our astonishment, even if we allow for absence of microscope, grows
acuter, when we are met in the three most important Ichthyologists
before the eighteenth century, Belon, Salviani, and Rondolet, with the
same silence.</p>

<p>And this fate of silence apparently prevails even after Leeuwenhoek’s
book; his discovery seems to have been lost or remained dormant in his
pages till a score of years ago.</p>

<p>Had microscopes existed in his day, we may surely surmise that
Aristotle would have perfected the system of scale-reading, and thus
have come down to posterity with his title of “The Philosopher of the
many Rings” better earned than by his foppish affection for jewellery.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>In general opinion, the person most closely approaching the required
Proteus or Nereus was his pupil and sometime friend, Alexander the
Great. By placing at his disposal several thousand men to collect all
kinds of animals and fishes from all parts of the then known world, he
enabled him with the aid of the materials thus provided to produce his
famous <i>Natural History</i>.</p>

<p>For this identification we have not a scrap of internal evidence, but
merely the assertions of much later writers, such as Pliny, Athenæus
(who adds that Philip gave him 800 talents to finish the <i>History</i>),
and Ælian.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>Apart from want of intrinsic evidence, the fact that the geographical
references and the fish mentioned in his <i>Natural History</i> nearly
all cluster round Lesbos effectually precludes the idea of Alexander
“Hagenbecking” for Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>Internal evidence and reasons advanced by Professor D’Arcy
Thompson<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
indicate that nearly all the animals and fishes with which Aristotle
was practically acquainted belonged to Greece, Western Asia, and
Sappho’s Lesbos (especially of the lagoon of Pyrrha), where he lived
some four years just previous to his Macedonian trip, 343 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>The fishes in his <i>Natural History</i>, mostly given without any
attempt at classification or really adequate description, number
at least one hundred and ten. He discusses in some instances the
anatomical characteristics, food, breeding habits, migrations, and
modes of capture. Of the hundred and ten only some fifty fish can be
scientifically identified; of which, all save six come from the sea.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>This figure of about one hundred and ten speaks wonders for his
industry and knowledge. Even after the lapse of 1800 years separating
him from the sixteenth century, the list of Mediterranean fishes
compiled by Belon comprises but a hundred or so, and by Rondolet but
some one hundred and sixty names. Risso, writing as late as 1810,
furnishes no more than three hundred and fifteen, of which he asserts
that eighty-eight had never been previously described.</p>

<p>Not unnaturally, this industry and this knowledge caused our author
to be at Athens not only a stumbling-block unto the wise, but “a
very wonder unto fools,” as the comedians said, who fastened on an
occasional lapse, such as his theory that the whole race of shell fish
generate without connection.</p>

<p>The <i>Natural History</i> nevertheless will always remain a monument of
extraordinary diligence and mental vigour, especially when we bear
in mind that he seemingly lacked any antiseptic preparation for the
preservation of specimens. His pre-eminence of merit is indicated
by the fact that of all the Greek and Latin authors he approximates
nearest to some idea of zoological system.</p>

<p>And yet this father of science and this founder of logic makes a direct
personal appeal to us as a man very human in his life and tastes.
Epicurus, “that most truthful of men,”<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
alleges that, when young, Aristotle went the pace, and squandered his
patrimony in good living and other pleasant delights. In addition to
his love for jewellery and personal adornment we discover him as a
great connoisseur of beautiful silver, of which he bequeathed over seventy
rare bowls. He ranks in opsophagy as an epicure of the highest order.</p>

<p>It is curious to note that in Aristotle, who apparently was familiar
with most, if not all, of the then existent methods, no mention, as
far as I can recall, occurs of <i>actual</i> fishing, save his story of the
fight and escape of a big <i>Glanis</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>He owed his knowledge largely to his intercourse with fishermen and
his close acquaintance with the fish markets—a haunting of which
in Mediterranean ports was, as in Naples it still is, productive of
a liberal education from the numerous specimens displayed and the
hundreds of vernacular names applied to them.</p>

<p>Contrast this with our British markets, where, despite our more
favourable wealth of sea-harvest, the kinds on sale seldom exceed a
score or so, and their vernacular names hardly reach half-a-hundred.</p>

<p>Granting, however, all the advantages accruing from such
acquaintance<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
with fishers and fishmongers, it needed an Aristotle to produce a
book of such keen observation and (generally) accurate conclusions as
his <i>Natural History</i>: for be it remembered that this, when compared
with the vast volume of his other works, is a mere by-product of his
industry and intellect, thrown off probably in the few years of his banishment.</p>

<p>Little escaped his ken, or his pen.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
At one moment he notes that neither hermaphroditism nor parthenogenesis
are uncommon, at the next he deals with the senses in fish. The
question whether fish do actually <i>hear</i> or do not <i>hear</i>, remains,
<i>comme les pauvres</i>, always with us; it remains like Etna dormant for
decades, suddenly to pour forth columns of print which lava-like scar
the fair face of many a ream of paper.</p>

<p>Aristotle comes down flat-footed in his verdict: fishes (we read, IV.
8) in spite of having no visible auditory organs undoubtedly do hear;
“for they are observed to run away from any loud noises like the rowing
of a galley. Indeed some people dwelling near the sea affirm that of
all living creatures the fish is the quickest of hearing.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Space forbids my dwelling on the various theories as to whether the
undoubted effect of their being disturbed by certain noises is attained
by hearing proper, or by vibration acting on the surface part of the
fish and communicating instantly with the internal ear.</p>

<p>Day’s summary of the question, still regarded after thirty years
as fair and conclusive, even if attaching undue importance to the
fontanelles, is as follows. “Hearing is developed in fish, and it is
very remarkable how any diversity of opinion can exist as to their
possessing this sense. The internal auditory apparatus is placed within
the cranial cavity: its chief constituent parts are the labyrinth,
which is composed of three semi-circular canals, and a vestibule,
which latter expands into one or more sacs, where the ear bones or
otoliths are lodged. A tympanum and tympanic cavity are absent. They
possess fontanelles between the bones, forming the roof of the skull,
which being closed by very thin bones or skin permit sounds from the
surrounding water to be readily transmitted to the contiguous internal
ears. But the chief mode in which hearing is carried on must be due to
the surface of the fish being affected by vibration of the water, and
the sounds are transmitted directly to the internal ear, or else by
means of the air-bladder acting as a sounding drum.”<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>It goes against the grain to differ with such a charmful and theme-ful
author as Sir Herbert Maxwell. But his conclusion<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
that fish in Loch Ken were disturbed every time a shooting party half
to three-quarters of a mile away discharged their guns cannot be
reconciled with the experiments made by me in July 1918 to test the
behaviour of trout, when guns were fired, not half a mile away, but
quite close to them.</p>

<p>Three of us, all accustomed to watching fish, selected a narrow shallow
burn in which the trout ran from fingerlings up to fish three or four
years old. Each in turn fired the gun (an ordinary 12 bore C.F.), with
the usual shooting charge of powder and No. 5 shot. At the first two
trials only was the shot extracted, so as to eliminate any vibration
set up by its striking the opposite bank. Two of us lying hidden in the
grass observed from different spots.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>The gun was fired eight feet, four feet, and three feet above the
surface of the stream, which varied in breadth from eight to ten feet,
and in depth from sixteen to nineteen inches. It was fired into the
air and into the opposite bank (struck from four to two feet above the
water) in a direct line above different fishes, lying either singly or
in shoals from five to nine inches from the bottom in small pools or
runs sixteen to nineteen inches deep. Care was taken to fire up stream,
to prevent the trout being startled by the flash of the cartridge.</p>

<p>In no case did the trout take the very least notice, or give any sign
of having heard the explosion or felt the concussion of the shot on the
opposite bank, composed on three occasions of alluvial soil and on two
of rock. Never once did a fish move or go down: in fact, in one of the
experiments over a single well-grown trout, the fish was rising again
to the natural fly in less than thirty seconds after the discharge of
the gun.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>Aristotle almost certainly learnt dissection when young. His father
belonged to the Asclepiads, an order of priest-physicians who are
believed to have practised dissection and taught it to their children.
The son’s extensive knowledge of the internal parts of mammals,
birds, and fishes probably resulted from dissections. Mr. Lones names
forty-nine animals and fishes which from the trustworthiness of the
definite information imparted were (he holds) certainly dissected. Of
these some five are fish.</p>

<p>To the question whether Aristotle ever dissected the human body, the
answer after examining the evidence available must, I think, be in the
negative, for three reasons. First: after describing the external parts
of the human body he states that the internal parts are less known than
those of animals, and that we must, in order to describe them, examine
the corresponding parts of animals which are most nearly related to man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Second: his many mistakes—such as in the position of the heart being
above the lungs, the emptiness of the occiput, etc.—can hardly be
casual slips made by one familiar with human dissection. The passage,
however, in <i>Nat. Hist.</i>, VII. 3, points distinctly to his having to
some degree dissected the <i>fœtus</i>.</p>

<p>But this would not conflict with the third and weightiest reason,
namely the strong repugnance felt by the Greeks to any mutilation of
the body proper and any neglect of speedy burial. The sad appeal of the
shade of the unburied Patroclus (<i>Il.</i>, XXIII. 71 ff.): “Bury me with
all speed that I pass the gates of Hades. Far off the spirits banish
me, nor do the phantoms of men outworn suffer me to mingle with them
beyond the river,” the fervent desire of some of Homer’s Heroes that
funeral rites should promptly follow their death,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
and the agony of Antigone, all these and other instances manifest Greek
sentiment. So strong and widespread was this that human dissection
would have certainly aroused intense bitterness and probably caused
the perpetual banishment of the perpetrator. The suggestion, resting
on no evidence, that Aristotle dissected the human body <i>secretly</i>
can neither be proved, nor disproved.</p>

<p>The Japanese, till recently, also refrained from dissection of the
human body. It was not till the arrival in 1873 of Professor W. Donitz
to fill the Chair of Anatomy in the newly established Academy of
Medicine in Tokyo that dissection first came to be employed. This new
era of medical science started under the happiest circumstances, for
frequent hangings, an aftermath of internal strife, provided ample
material for its prosecution.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

of Sappho in Part X. of the <i>Oxyrhynchus Papyri</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>or in the articles
on them by Mr. J. M. Edmonds in the <i>Classical Review</i> of May 1914
and June 1916, a second fisher epigram, or at any rate an allusion to
fishing. Alas! the Papyri yield some amatory, but no piscatory verses.
Apparently neither Sappho nor Alcæus make any other reference to fishing.</p>

<p>The verses of Alcæus stress poverty even more strongly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“The fisher Diotimus had at sea</span>
<span class="i4">And shore the same abode of poverty—</span>
<span class="i4">His trusty boat—and when his days were spent,</span>
<span class="i4">Therein self-rowed, to ruthless Dis he went:</span>
<span class="i4">For that which did through life his woes beguile,</span>
<span class="i4">Supplied the old man with a funeral pile.”<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>“From fragments of Greek Comedy it is evident that
fishers were among the familiar characters on the stage, and
were sometimes the protagonists.” Examination of the Old,
Middle and New Comedians confirm Dr. Hall.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>In Epicharmus (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 540-450) the reputed founder of Comedy in
Sicily; in Sophron’s <i>The Fisherman and the Clown</i>, where the former
naturally outwits the country boor; in Plato the comedian’s <i>Phaon</i>,
where he may have ridiculed the legend of Sappho’s vain love for the
Lesbian fisherman; in <i>The Fishes</i> by Archippus, where people were
satirised under the names of fishes spelled in the same way as their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
own; or (to pass from Old to Middle Comedy) in <i>The Fisher-Woman</i> by
Antiphanes (in the fragments of which, however, we are confronted by no
Sex problem, by no Suffragettism<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>);
and (of the New Comedy authors) in Menander’s <i>The Fishermen</i> (where we
gather from Pollux that a fisher came on the stage fully equipped for
fishing), in all these plays and many more appear fisher
folk.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>Archippus’ drama deserves a moment’s notice, because in imitation
of Aristophanes’ <i>Birds</i> the poet ventured on a chorus composed
exclusively of <i>Fishes</i>. Extant fragments of the play (performed
probably in 413 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) tell of war being declared by the
fish against their oppressors the Athenians, who were passionate
opsophagists. The principal condition of the Peace Points—whether
<i>Fourteen</i> or more our data do not determine—secured the prompt
delivery to the Fishes of the head of their chief foe, Melanthios.</p>

<p>If the protocol of this Treaty had attracted the notice of President
Wilson, who as a constitutional historian attaches importance to the
“broadening down from precedent to precedent,” the demands of the
Allies for the immediate surrender of our arch-enemy, the Kaiser, might
have been more insistent and scarcely less successful.</p>

<p>And so from the first <i>loci classici</i> of fishing in Homer we journey on
through the succeeding centuries. In nearly all we encounter fishing
and fishermen in literature or play. In the third <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> we
reach the next <i>locus classicus</i>—“The Fisherman’s Dream,” Idyll XXI.
of Theocritus.</p>

<p>“Theocritus is the creator of the literary piscatory, as he is also
of the literary bucolic.” This dictum would, I think, be rendered
more accurate by the substitution of modeller in place of creator.
Theocritus, even if we allow for Stesichorus, Epicharmus, and Sophron,
stands out the first, not to create but to gather, and by his genius
reduce to regular literary shape, the existent poems and songs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
(<i>Volkslieder</i>) which formed the stock in trade of the Bucoliastæ in
Cos, Sicily, and Magna Græcia.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>The influence of Theocritus on fishing literature in mime, epigram,
or romance is writ large in the pages not only of Moschus, Leonidas
of Tarentum, Alciphron, Plautus, Ovid, but also of Sannazaro in the
fifteenth, of our Spenser<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
and his followers in the sixteenth and subsequent centuries, and even
of Keats.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
This influence shows most widely in the more abundant literary bucolic.
Virgil, for instance, admits his model in the opening lines of
<i>Eclogue</i> IV.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sicelides Musæ, paulo maiora canamus ...</i></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A recent writer straightly asserts that “without Theocritus the
Bucolics (save the mark!) of Virgil could never have been conceived,
or, if conceived, would have miscarried.”<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>Whether or not the offspring of this parentage is not too savagely
depreciated, we note with surprise that Virgil,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Thou that singest wheat and woodland, tilth and vineyard, hive and</span>
<span class="i10">horse and herd;</span>
<span class="i4">All the charm of all the Muses often flowering in a lonely word,”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>a professed imitator of Theocritus, to whom fishermen were as
familiar as the waters by which they lived and figured in many of his
<i>Idylls</i>,<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> never mentions fishermen in his <i>Bucolics</i>.</p>

<p>His only (I believe) allusions to them—and the first is merely
incidental to an account of the primitive Arts of Man, and how fishing
as an Art came in only as the Golden Age went out—are in <i>Georgic</i>,
I. 141-2, <i>Atque alius latum funda iam verberat amnem</i> | <i>Alta petens,
pelagoque alius trahit humida lina</i>, and in the <i>Æneid</i> (XII. 517 ff.):</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Et iuvenem exosum nequiquam bella Menœten,</span>
<span class="i0">Arcada, piscosæ cui circum flumina Lernæ</span>
<span class="i0">Ars fuerat, pauperque domus, nec nota potentum</span>
<span class="i0">Munera, conductaque pater tellure serebat.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Even in these four lines observe how insistently rings out the note of
<i>poverty</i>!—the constant characteristic, the almost invariable badge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
as we shall soon see, of every professional fisherman in Greek poems,
plays, or writers from Homer down to the later Greek Romanticists,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
or (as far as I know) in the epigrams from 700 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> to 500
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, of the <i>Anthologia Palatina</i>.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>“The figure of the weather-beaten fisher is a favourite one in the old
poets, and we meet it constantly in Art; in Greek, and in Roman Art
especially, it was a very favourite subject.”<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>M. Campaux, Mr. Hall, and Herr Bunsmann confirm and amplify this
sentence of Blümner’s. The thesis of Bunsmann—not easy to obtain,
although published in 1910 at Münster in Westphalia—seems within its
limited scope (he scarcely touches on the methods or craft of fishing)
perhaps the best little treatise <i>De Piscatorum in Græcorum atque
Romanorum litteris usu</i>.</p>

<p>He sets out to discover and formulate a list of the characteristics
most frequently attributed to fishermen. He proceeds to establish each
of the dozen selected by buttressing questions from Homer down to Sidonius.</p>

<p>Hospitality, Piety to the Gods and Dead, Shrewd (almost Pawky) Humour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Old Age, Toil and Poverty figure most prominently. I can only notice
one or two of the passages cited in support of each characteristic, but
the evidence adduced generally carries conviction.</p>

<p>On the Hospitality of fishermen, poor though it were, stress is laid by
Greek and Roman writers.</p>

<p>Bunsmann’s citation of Petronius (<i>Sat.</i>, 114) and Plutarch (<i>Vita
Pompeii</i>, 73) as witnesses to credit is, however, far from happy,
especially in the case of the former, who recounts that when the boat
had been so battered as to be a-wash “procurrere piscatores parvulis
expediti navigiis <i>ad prædam rapiendam</i>.” The lightning-like change of
the fishermen, on realising that their intended victims were ready to
defend themselves, from plunderers to helpers, and the non-denial to
the shipwrecked folk of the use of their hut for eating some sea-sodden
food, scarcely shine as exemplars of high Hospitality. No wonder the
guests dragged out a “most miserable night.”</p>

<p>Tyrrhenus, the old deaf fisherman in <i>The Ethiopian History</i> (omitted
by Bunsmann), embodies a far better instance of the characteristic
Hospitality. His glad welcome and the surrender to his guests of “the
cosier part of his dwelling” betoken Nature’s gentleman.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>A still better instance meets us in the Greek romance of <i>Apollonius
of Tyre</i><a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
possibly an imitation of the Heliodorus idyll. The prince, sole
survivor of a shipwreck, is found, fed, clad, and afterwards directed
by an old fisherman to Pentapolis, where he wins a competition before
the king. This romance, which survives in a Latin version of the sixth
century, became in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries widely popular
and translated into most European languages. To it, as the scenes and
the characters prove, Shakespeare, or possibly Wilkins, must have owed
much of his <i>Pericles</i>.</p>

<p>On the question whence originated their Piety to the Gods, whether it
sprang from or was only influenced by the fact that their lives were
passed amid the unknown but ever-present and awful forces of Nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
identified with certain gods, or sprang rather from a gratitude
proportioned to future benefits, Bunsmann is discreetly non-committal.</p>

<p>But of outward and visible signs of such Piety the <i>Anthologia
Palatina</i> is eloquent. Their Piety towards the dead is strikingly
attested by Hegesippus, the simplicity of whose style in his eight
epigrams in <i>Anth. Pal.</i> betokens an early date. “The fishermen brought
up from the sea in their net a half-eaten man, a most mournful relic of
some voyage. They sought not for unholy gain, but him and the fishes
too they buried under this light coat of sand.”<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>Bunsmann furnishes two records of impiety among fishermen. The first
occurs in the well-known <i>Baiano procul a lacu recede</i> of Martial
(<i>Epigr.</i>, IV. 30), where an impious poacher in the very act of
landing his fish from the Emperor’s lake is stricken with blindness.
The second, in Athen., VII. 18, and Ælian, XV. 23, where Epopeus, a
fisherman of the island of Icarus, enraged by taking nothing but sacred
or <i>tabu Pompili</i>, turned to with his son and devoured them, only
themselves in turn to be devoured by a whale.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>But the <i>impietas</i> charged from <i>Anth. Pal.</i>, VI. 24, is fantastic.
The indictment has been drawn owing either to mistranslation of the passage
or inability to appreciate the rather heavy-handed humour (frequent in
the Greek and Roman writers of the time) of Lucilius, a conjectured
author of the Epigram.</p>

<p>Heliodorus lays down at the portals of the temple of “the Syrian
goddess” a votive offering of his fishing net worn out, not by catches
of fish, but of seaweed “from the beaches of goodly havens.” This
dedication, as fish were sacred to the goddess and in Syria were
forbidden as a food, has been imputed as an affront to the deity,
but quite incorrectly. Heliodorus in offering his net intended no
disrespect, nor offended any law of the temple. Since its sole catch
had been seaweed, his net could plead “pure from the prey of fishery.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>The point of the pleasantry is akin to the caustic defence offered
on behalf of a Jewish portrait painter, “as none of the pictures are
<i>likenesses</i>, he is guiltless of breaking the Second Commandment!”</p>

<p>Ovid’s pretty fancy to account for the Syrian abstention doubtless
hangs together with the Greek conception of Atargatis and Aphrodite
being one and the same. When the Giants revolted against the Gods,
Venus fleeing with Cupid reaches, but is stayed by, the Euphrates:
thither, <i>Palæstinæ margine aquæ</i>, in answer to her piteous plaints to
heaven above and earth below, two fish approach and convey mother and
child safely across the flood.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Inde nefas ducunt genus hoc imponere mensis</span>
<span class="i3">Nec violant timidi piscibus ora Syri.”</span>
<span class="i20"><i>Fasti</i>, II. 473-4.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But other books, other legends! for the same author (in <i>Met.</i>, V. 331)
tells us that in the battle Venus changes herself into a fish.</p>

<p>Ktesias gives another account.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
Derceto by the wiles of Aphrodite “fell in love with a beautiful young
man and was brought to bed of a daughter: being ashamed of what she had
done, she slew the young man, exposed in the desert the child (who, fed
with milk and then with cheese by pilfering pigeons, grew up to become
the famous Semiramis) and then cast herself into the lake at Ascalon
and was transformed into a fish—whence it came to pass that at this
very day the Syrians eat no fishes, but adore them as gods” (Booth’s Trans.).</p>

<p>Of the instances of <i>calliditas</i> or shrewd wit of fishermen, the story
(<i>supra</i>) of the fisher lads’ answer to Homer and the following from
Alciphron (I. 16) must suffice, although from Æsop, etc., many others
can be gleaned. The whole passage is far too long for quotation, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the final retort of the fisher, whose request for a battered disused
boat has been selfishly refused by its owner, furnishes, according to
a German critic, “a perfect gem of the Art of the Sophist, and sounds
itself like an insoluble riddle.”</p>

<p>To enable the reader to form his own judgment on this particular
instance of <i>calliditas</i>, I subjoin the retort: οὐκ ᾔτησά σε ἃ ἕχεις
ἀλλ’ ἃ μὴ ἓχεις ἐπεὶ δὲ οὐ βούλει ἃ μὴ ἓχεις ἕτερον ἕχειν, ἕχε ἃ μὴ
ἓχεις, “I didn’t ask you for what you have, but for what you haven’t.
Since, however, you don’t wish another to have what you haven’t, what
you haven’t you can have!”</p>

<p>But apart from this and similar instances of <i>calliditas</i>, the mood of
piscatory poetry is generally serious or melancholy, and in keeping
with the surroundings; we look in vain for the sunny warmth of Sicilian
meadows, where youths pipe and sing gaily.</p>

<p>Like their modern brethren fishermen offered, before setting sail
or after returning safe from dangers encountered, gifts to the gods
of their craft, of whom first came Poseidon or Neptune, usually
represented with a trident<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>;
second, Hermes or Mercury, the most venerated, because of his wily cunning and ready
ruses<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>;
third, Pan, a son of Mercury, who taught him all his craft,<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
and fourth, Priapus.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
It is with a start of surprise that one finds Priapus, far more
notorious as the god of propagation and fecundity, among the gods of
fisherfolk. Can this be accounted for by some subtle, but inverse
connection between the belief in India that the Fish was the symbol of
Fecundation, and the God of Fecundation in Greece? Some support for
this may lie in the statement of de Gubernatis, that as in the East the
fish was a phallic symbol, so now <i>pesce</i> in the Neapolitan dialect
means the <i>phallus</i> itself.</p>

<p>His lineage, either the son of Hermes, or his grandson, for among the
many putative fathers of Priapus was Pan, may account for the inclusion
of Priapus. To Priapus, arriving how he may at goddom, offerings were
more freely made than to any other except Hermes.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>In addition to these four flourished minor gods. Goddesses too of
Fishing (such as Artemis<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>), of rivers, of springs, and of the fish
therein found devotees. First and foremost, ranked Aphrodite or Venus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i45">“But she</span>
<span class="i0">Came flushed from the full-flushed wave, and imperial, her foot on</span>
<span class="i6">the sea,</span>
<span class="i0">And the wonderful waters knew her, the winds, and the viewless ways,</span>
<span class="i0">And the roses grew rosier, and bluer the sea-blue stream of the bays.”</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>To her, seemingly, as many offerings, as many prayers were made as to any god.</p>

<p>Whether she can be identified or not with Atargatis, through Derceto
or Astarte, matters little here.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
But the image of the goddess, as described by
Lucian,<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>
“In Phœnicia, I saw the image of Derceto, a strange sight truly! For
she had the half of a woman, and from the thighs downwards a fish’s
tail,” corresponds closely with an image of Ascalon,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
“having the face of a woman, but all the rest of the body a fish.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <a name="ARTEMIS" id="ARTEMIS"></a>
   <img src="images/i_p127.jpg" alt=" " width="600" height="328" />
   <p class="f120">ARTEMIS WITH A LARGE FISH IN FRONT OF HER DRESS.</p>
   <p class="f90">From <i>Ephemeris Archélogique</i>, Pl. 10.</p>
</div>

<p>When in addition we find this same image at Ascalon stated by Herodotus
(II. 115) to be that “of the heavenly Aphrodite,” the identification
of the Greek-Roman goddess appears, at any rate, to have gained wide
acceptance. Doubtless Horace had this,<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
or perhaps some fish-tailed Egyptian goddess, in mind when he penned
his famous comparison for an incoherent simile: “Desinit in piscem
mulier formosa superne.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>Coins of Hierapolis in Cyrrhestica often show Atargatis riding on a
lion or enthroned between two lions,<a name="FNanchor_298_298"
id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298"
class="fnanchor">[298]</a> sometimes with the legend ΘΕΑΣ ΣΥΡΙΑΣ,
‘of the Syrian goddess.’ Strabo (XVI. 27, p. 748) tells us that this
city worshipped the Syrian goddess Atargatis, who (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 785)
according to Ktesias the historian was called also Derceto.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>Another reason for abstention from fish, apart from their sacredness
to the goddess, we owe to Antipater of Tarsus.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
Gatis, queen of Syria, developed such a passion for fish that she
issued a proclamation forbidding their being eaten without her being
invited (ἄτερ Γάτιδος). Hence the common people thought her name was
Atargatis and abstained wholly from fish.</p>

<p>Mnaseas<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
assigns to her the deserved and not inappropriate fate of
being thrown into her own lake near Ascalon and devoured by fishes.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
But against this legend must be placed the fact that Atargatis, in
common with many Asian deities and cults translated westward, found
sanctuary and high veneration, in her case at Delos.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Theocritus in the fragment on Berenice recommends the sacrifice of a
certain fish to a goddess. “And if any man that hath his livelihood
from the salt sea, and whose nets serve him for ploughs, prays for
wealth and luck in fishing, let him sacrifice, at midnight, to this
goddess, the sacred fish that men call ‘silver white,’ for that it is
brightest of sheen of all; then let the fisher set his nets, and he
shall draw them full from the sea.”<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>If Apollonius of Tyana had been compelled to commend a beauteous fish
for sacrifice—an act which his Pythagorean tenets forbade—he must
have plumped for the Peacock fish.</p>

<p>Whether he were, <i>teste</i> Hieroclas, as great a sage, as remarkable
a worker of miracles, as potent an exorcist as <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>
of Nazareth, or merely, in the words of Eusebius, a rank charlatan,
whose magic, “if he possessed any,” was the gift of the powers of
evil with whom he lived in league is no question to be considered
here. Apollonius, at any rate, stands out, not only as one of the most
interesting and most discussed personalities of the third century, but
also as one of the most travelled.</p>

<p>During his fifty odd <i>Wanderjahre</i> many men had he known, and many
cities had he seen of Asia and Africa. In the Hyphasis river of India
there exist (we learn from his <i>Life by Philostratus</i>, III. 1) Peacock
fish (sacred to Aphrodite) to which, if colour or “silver sheen” insure
full creels, the Theocritean certainly must yield place, for “their
fins are blue, their scales beautifully dappled, their tails, which
fold or spread at will, of golden hue!”</p>

<p>But dominant over all other characteristics stands the inevitable and
insistent connection of fishermen with Old Age, Toil, and Poverty.
Everywhere, in every author, does this note strike loudest; nowhere,
have I come across a <i>young</i> fisherman, except Virgil’s Menœtes.</p>

<p>These characteristics find their place not only in Greek and Latin
literature from and before the “sleepless chase” of Sophocles (<i>Ajax</i>, 880)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
to the last Romanticist,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
but also in the statuary, pictures, frescoes, mosaics of Greek and
Roman Art. Numerous examples can be cited from the museums of Naples,
Rome, Paris, and London sustaining the contention that all real
fishermen were ever depicted old and careworn.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>The fishing boys and women of the <i>Amorini</i> at Pompeii and elsewhere
may be adduced as vitiating this statement: but these, it must be
borne in mind, are merely artistic representations of Anglers and
of dalliance, not of real fishermen toiling for their livelihood.
So, too, in the Greek representations where boys, not <i>Putti</i> or
<i>Amorini</i>, figure as fishing, it will be found that they are helpers or
“fish-boys” of the working fisherman.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>The explanations why fishermen are so rendered vary. Perhaps the
truest, certainly the concisest, is Alciphron’s, τρέφει γὰρ οὐδέν’ ἡ
θάλαττα—the sea feeds no one. According to Bunsmann, fishermen are
always represented as old and poor and worn, because their delineators
desired by painting the career as blackly as possible to excite
sympathy. For this purpose old age and poverty and heavy toil, which
appeal unto all, stood ready as their most effective strokes.</p>

<p>According to Hall, the fisher, a common character in all Greek
literature, was in early times described with simple truth. Only later,
when imitation took the place of originality, did conventionalism
render him always as aged, pathetic, superstitious, wretchedly poor,
yet patient and content.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Whatever be the reason, Greek fishermen, whether we read of them in
the Epigrams or in the fragments of lost works, all come down as old,
patient, half-starved through dint of toil by day and night, sea-worn.
Their horny hands grasp better a trident than hold the delicate
pastoral reeds. They play no tunes, they dance no dances, they sing no
songs save some rowing chant, as they tug at the oars when homeward bound.</p>

<p>“’Tis poverty alone, Diophantus, that awakens the arts; Poverty, the
very teacher of labour. Nay, not even sleep is permitted by weary cares
to men that live by toil, and if, for a little while, one closes his
eyes in the night, cares throng about him and suddenly disquiet his slumber.</p>

<p>“Two fishers, on a time, two old men, together lay down and slept—they
had strown the dry sea-moss for a bed in their wattled cabin, and
there they lay against the leafy wall. Beside them were strewn the
instruments of their toilsome hands, the fishing creels, the rods of
reed, the hooks, the sails bedraggled with sea-spoil, the lines, the
weels, the lobster pots woven of rushes, the seines, two oars, and an
old coble upon props. Beneath their heads was a scanty matting, their
clothes, their sailor’s caps. Here was all their toil, here all their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
wealth. The threshold had never a door, nor a watch-dog; all things,
all to them seemed superfluity, for poverty was their sentinel. They
had no neighbour by them, but ever against their cabin floated up the sea.</p>

<p>“The chariot of the moon had not yet reached the mid-point of her
course, but their familiar toil awakened the fishermen; from their
eyelids they cast out slumber, and roused their souls with speech.”</p>

<p>Asphalion, after complaining that even the nights in summer are too
long—for “already have I seen ten thousand dreams, and the dawn is not
yet”—is somewhat comforted by the thought that thus “we have time to
idle in, for what could a man find to do lying on a leafy bed beside
the waves and slumbering not? Nay, the ass is among the thorns, the
lantern in the town hall, for they say it is always sleepless.”<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>Then he begs his friend to interpret to him the dream he has just dreamt.</p>

<p>“As I was sleeping late, amid the labours of the salt sea, (and truly
not too full fed, for we supped early, if thou dost remember, and did
not overtax our bellies), I saw myself busy on a rock, and there I sat
and watched the fishes and kept spinning the bait with the rods.</p>

<p>“And one of the fishes nibbled, a fat one; for, in sleep, dogs dream
of bread, and of fish dream I.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
Well, he was tightly hooked, and the blood was running, and the rod
I grasped was bent with his struggle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>“So with both hands I strained, and had a sore tussle for the monster.
How was I ever to land so big a fish with hooks all too slim? Then,
just to remind him he was hooked, I gently pricked him, pricked, and
slackened; and as he did not run, I took in line.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>“My toil was ended with the sight of my prize. I drew up a golden fish,
lo, you! a fish all plated thick with gold. Then fear took hold of me
lest he might be some fish beloved of Poseidon, or perchance some jewel
of the sea-grey Amphitrite. Gently I unhooked him, lest even the hooks
should retain some of the gold of his mouth. Then I dragged him ashore
with the ropes,<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
and swore that never again would I set foot on sea, but abide on land
and lord it over the gold.</p>

<p>“This was what awakened me, but for the rest set thy mind to it,
my friend, for I am in dismay about the oath I swore.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Friend</i>: “Nay, never fear, thou art no more sworn than thou hast
found the golden fish<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
of thy vision: dreams are but lies. But if thou wilt search these
waters, wide awake and not asleep, there is some hope in thy slumbers:
seek the fish of flesh, lest thou die of famine with all thy dreams of gold!”</p>

<p>The influence of Theocritus, though becoming less natural and rendered
more conventional by the pretty conceits of the later Alexandrian
period,<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
permeates the literature of Greece and Rome for many centuries. In
none, perhaps, is this influence more marked than in his pupils Bion
and Moschus, and in his younger contemporary, Leonidas of Tarentum.</p>

<p>Three fisher epigrams<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
by Leonidas suffice as evidence of this. The realism, the pathos, the
detailed treatment, the subjects, lowly folk, all alike characterise
the Sicilian.</p>

<p>In the first, the fisherman Diophantus on giving up his trade
dedicates, according to custom, all the relics of his calling to the
patron of his craft. The list of the implements, including a well-bent
hook, long rod, and line of horse hair, here and in an epigram by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Philippus of Thessalonica (which adds “the flint pregnant with fire,
that sets alight the tinder”), corresponds in material and order of
enumeration fairly closely with Asphalion’s in Theocritus.</p>

<p>Of the second I borrow a spirited translation of the last lines,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The third, which should be <i>The Awful Warning</i>, if any warning avail,
to boys fishing in the middle of a burn and holding while changing
their lure a fish in their teeth (who of us has not done this?), sets a
picture of a more violent death, “for the slippery thing went wriggling
down his narrow gullet,” and choked him on the spot.</p>

<p>Alciphron, judging from his extant letters, seems the most prolific of
the later Piscatory writers. His tribute to the veracity of Sosias,
“who is famous for the delicious sauce made of the fish which he
entices,” reads in such deadly opposition to the common but false
impression that fishermen rank next to mining engineers as the biggest
liars in the world, that it must be quoted, if only on the principle of
“An angler to a brother angler gave.”</p>

<p>“He is one of those who duly reverence Truth, and such an one would
never even slip into Falsehood.”</p>

<p>Lest as an Angler I may be accused of “slipping into Falsehood” in my
translation, I subjoin the Greek:</p>

<p>Ἔστι δὲ τῶν ἐπιεικῶς τὴι ἀλήθειαν τιμώντων, καὶ οὐκ ἄν ποτ’ ἐκεῖνος εἰς
ψευδηγορίαν ὀλίσθοι.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>Lucian’s <i>Dialogues of the Sea Gods</i>, by their confidential chat, give
witty expression to the author’s own scepticism towards mythology.
“With their imitation of the earlier poets and their amœbean form they
may be considered as connecting links between Theocritus and others of
his group and the eclogues of marine mythology, sometimes classed as
piscatory eclogues during the renaissance.”<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>If any doubt be as to their being “links,” there can be none as to
the charm of <i>The Dialogues</i> of (in Macaulay’s words) “the last great
master of Attic eloquence, and Attic wit,” or (he has been perhaps
equally well termed) “the first of the moderns.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Fisherman</i>, by the same author, bears no relationship to the
Mimes, or Idylls. It takes its title from a scene in which the author
sits on a parapet of the Acropolis equipped with the rod of a Piræan
fisherman. His bait of gold and figs attracts a swarm of brilliantly
coloured fish, <i>Salmo Cynicus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
<i>Flat Sole Plateship</i>, and other philosophers clad in scales.</p>

<p>The Romances, the last prose at times instinct with the genius of
ancient Greece, bequeath us many fisherfolk. The famous pastoral
<i>Daphnis and Chloe</i>, by Longus, introduces a pretty picture and
illustrates the old contrast between the idyllic life of shepherds and
the sordid lot of their fishing neighbours.</p>

<p>Daphnis sits with Chloe on a hill near the sea; “while at their meal,
which, however, consisted more of kisses than of food, a fisher boat
is seen proceeding along the coast.” The crew, carrying freshly caught
fish to a rich man in the city, “dip their oars, doing what sailors
usually do to beguile their toil—the boatswain sings a sea-song, and
the rest join in chorus at stated intervals.”</p>

<p>As the boat reaches some hollow or crescent-shaped bay, the echo of
their song floats up. This only incites Daphnis, who understands the
echo, “to store up some of the strains in his memory that he may play
them on his pipes, but Chloe, who wots not that such things can be,
turns in pretty bewilderment to the boat, to the sea, and to the woods.”</p>

<p>The <i>Aethiopica</i>, by Heliodorus of Emesa, has been termed, perhaps with
exaggeration, the most elaborate picture of a piscatory kind in ancient
Greek. The influence of Theocritus is strongly suggested by the imagery
incidental to the description of the cabin, the tackle, and the boat,
as well as by the delineation of the character of Tyrrhenus, aged,
sea-worn, wretchedly poor, yet content with his lot and hospitable to
the stranger.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Agathias gives us one of the very few, perhaps the only, fisher epigram
with a love motive. “A fisherman was employed in catching fish. Him did
a damsel of property see, and was affected in her heart with desire,
and made him the partner of her bed. But he, after a life of poverty,
took on himself the swell of all kinds of high bearing, and Fortune
with a smile was standing by, and said to Venus,—‘This is not your
contest, but mine.’”<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>Lastly it is of interest to note that one of the few Greek poetesses
concerned herself with a love-tale of the sea. Hedyle, who came of a
poetic stock (for she was daughter of Moschine the iambist and mother
of Hedylus the epigrammatist), penned a poem on Glaucus’ love for
Scylla. In it she told how the love-sick swain would repair to the
cavern of his mistress—</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class="h_subtitle">THE TWO PLINYS—MARTIAL—WAS THE ROD JOINTED?</span></h3></div>

<p>After Theocritus we reach the period which chronologically might
perhaps be termed that of the Roman writers, although our two greatest
authorities on Fish Lure and Lore wrote in Greek, some three to four
centuries after Plautus (<i>c.</i> 254-184 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) had produced his
<i>Rudens</i>.</p>

<p>This, the first Latin play, I believe, introducing fishermen on the
stage, re-echoes the Greek note of poverty and misery. In Act II.,
Sc. 2, Trachalio asks, “Shellfish-gatherers, and hook-fishers, hungry
race of men, how fare ye?” and receives the answer, “Just as befits
fishermen; with hunger, thirst, and expectation.” The wretchedness of
their calling is made further manifest in Act II., Sc. 1.</p>

<p>Descriptions of fishermen are found in Latin adaptations of Greek
plays. The Latin mimes, as did the Greek, often display fishermen
as characters. The Latin references to actual fishing not only far
outnumber the Greek, but also, unlike the Greek, which are almost
solely concerned with sea fishing, frequently treat of river and lake
fishing. Plautus, Cicero, Horace, Ovid,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
Juvenal, Tibullus, Pliny the Elder and the Younger, Martial, and
Ausonius, by no means conclude the list of our Roman authors.</p>

<p>It may be fairly asked, why I omit any special notice of so valuable
and voluminous work as the <i>Natural History</i> of Pliny the Elder.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>My reasons are three. First, my book contains numberless references to
or quotations from it. Second, none of its thirty-seven Books presents
any controversial questions of angling interest—such as “Where is to
be found the first mention of the Rod, or Fly?”—questions which demand
for Martial and Ælian a full discussion. Third, my notice of Aristotle,
on the principle that the greater includes the less, renders any
lengthy comment on Pliny almost superfluous.</p>

<p>The <i>Natural History</i> of the latter, at any rate as far as fish and
fishing are concerned, for the most part repeats the <i>Natural History</i>
of the former, except in such instances as the caudal losses caused
by the enmity between the <i>Lupus</i> and the <i>Mugil</i>, and between the
<i>Conger</i> and the <i>Muræna</i>, where it exactly reverses Aristotle’s
statement.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>These and other instances, in addition to his words (IX. 88), “Nigidius
auctor est,” and (X. 19) “Nigidius tradit,” led J. G. Schneider<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
to conclude that it is open to grave doubt, whether Pliny ever read
Aristotle at all in the original Greek. The probabilities, indeed,
point to his having used for his <i>Natural History</i> the translation into
Latin of Aristotle, which Nigidius Figulus, a friend of Cicero’s and
(according to Gellius) next to Varro the most learned of the Romans,
published with additions apparently of his own.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>In Pliny the Younger, and Martial (perhaps Ovid in a lesser degree)
one finds what among our classical writers seems the nearest approach
to our English sportsman, delighting in his own place, however small,
in the country, and in country pursuits. These writers, in spite of
living half the year or more in Rome, fall within our conception of
country sportsmen.</p>

<p>Most of the others seem more intent on bringing the scent of the
hay before the footlights than on making us realise any real joy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
fishing. They resemble more the week-enders of a fishing syndicate than
the country gentleman living on his place or river.</p>

<p>Pliny the Younger possesses, in addition to his appreciation of the
various joys of country life, a passionate yet exquisite feeling for
beauty of scenery, especially for that round Lake Como, to which his
letters recur again and again.</p>

<p>I cannot, however, conceive him much of a hunter, despite the abundant
game which the Apennine or Laurentine coverts harboured, or much of a
<i>piscator</i>, despite his notices of fishing on his favourite lake. A
letter (<i>Epist.</i>, I. 6) to Tacitus, who had apparently been chaffing
him as a sportsman, frankly admits that although he has killed three
boars his chief pleasure in the chase consists of sitting quietly
beside the nets, to which the game was driven, wrapt in contemplation
or jotting down on his tablets the ideas which the solitude and silence
demanded by the sport were wont to produce.</p>

<p>As a fisherman he took his pleasure, if not sadly, for the most part
vicariously. He joyed more, if I read him aright, in watching from one
or other of his villas the boatmen toiling with their nets and lines
than in a day’s fishing, an impression which seems confirmed by his
appreciation of the joy of being able to angle from bed!</p>

<p>Thus we read in <i>Epist.</i>, IX. 7: “On the shores of Como I have several
villas, but two occupy me most ... That one feels no wave; this one
breaks them. From that, you may look down upon the fishermen below;
while from this, you may yourself fish, and lower your hook from your
bedroom—almost from your very bed—just as from a little boat.”<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>If the site of the present Villa Pliniana is that of the ancient Villa,

of the close proximity of the spring (which even now preserves the
unusual characteristics specified in his letter) we may safely conclude, the

<p>The mediæval writer, Paolo Giovio, dwells at length on the enormous
fish to be seen 350 years ago in the depths of Lake Como, and states
that trout of 100 lbs. and over were no uncommon objects.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>What a prospect of joyous, easeful sport is opened here! No tedious
travel of days or weeks to Norway, Canada, or New Zealand; no sleepless
roughing it under tent or shack; no diet of canned food; no being
“bitten off in chunks” by mosquito or black fly. Think of it, O Angler
of high hope, but of sore disappointment—of hard toil and weary
waiting! Think of it! To wake, after sound slumber, in one’s own
comfortable room: to seize the ready rod, and with one dexterous cast,
“almost from your very bed,” to be fast in a hundred-pound trout!</p>

<p>Martial’s abiding love for his birthplace on the picturesque banks
of the River Salo in Spain (the delights of which in <i>Ep.</i>, XII. 18,
and I. 49, he paints with happy enthusiasm to Rome-tied Juvenal and
to Licinianus) probably accounts for Angling being mentioned more
appreciatively by him than by any other Latin poet.</p>

<p>Angling was one of the favourite amusements of men like Martial, a
yeoman (if I may differ from Prof. Mackail<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>)
—to judge from the frequent references made to his own farm—or at any rate a
close observer of the class, which in <i>Ep.</i> I. 55, he so well describes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Hoc petit, esse sui nec magni ruris arator,</span>
<span class="i2">Sordidaque in parvis otia rebus amat.”</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>For in this same epigram and many others the poet is fain</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">“Ante focum plenas explicuisse plagas,</span>
<span class="i0">Et piscem tremula salientem ducere seta.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>To him these rank among the chief delights of country life, which life
he, though an admirable <i>flâneur</i>, places higher than all else.</p>

<p>He ends his vivid sketch of it with the passionate burst—“Let not the
man who loves not this life, love me, and let him go on with his city
life—white as his own toga!”<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>Martial’s charming picture of a Roman homestead, of its life,
live-stock, of its pursuits, and of its fishing,<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
contrasts vividly with his fawning eulogies of Emperors, and his
savage satire on foes. It must be confessed, however, that some of his
prettiest appreciations of country life were written in or about the
large villas with which his rich patrons had studded, too closely to be
really rural, Baiæ and the Bay of Naples.</p>

<p>His pleasure in this part of the coast was increased by the nearness of
the baths of Baiæ, and the Lacus Lucrinus, the home of the famous Roman oyster.</p>

<p>These oysters held, I think, the highest place in Martial’s gastronomic
affections. Constant his references to them, frequent his assertions
or assumptions that they excelled all other.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
His well known lament for a beautiful little slave girl, who died
when only six, employs as a term of highest praise <i>Concha Lucrini
delicatior stagni</i>, rendered by Paley “more delicate” (in complexion)
“than the mother-of-pearl in the shell of the Lucrine oyster.”<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Others hold that <i>concha</i> is meant for the oyster itself. One author,
basing himself on the varying praises of the particular beauties of the
child, rhapsodises thus: “Oysters<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
so tender, so juicy, so succulent, so delicious, that the poet could
find no fitter comparison for a charming young girl!” But in the words
of Jeffrey of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, “<i>This will never do.</i>” To twist
the verse into a comparison of pleasure derived from the sense of taste
rather than of beauty from the sense of sight passes the inadmissible,
and unless Martial could eat, or in Charles Lamb’s word on a gift of
game, “incorporate” the pretty child, reaches the ludicrous.</p>

<p>Martial shows up as a sportsman. Proud of a good day, he knows—and
tells us—what it is to be “blank” (“ecce redit sporta piscator inani,”
<i>Ep.</i>, X. 37, 17). That he is no “River Hog” and quite eligible for
some select club on the Test or Itchen appears from his throwing back
into his native river any mullet which looked less than three pounds.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
The interest attaching to his Epigrams lies not only in the evidence
they afford of his and his friends’ love for things piscatorial, but
also in the probability that in them we meet with the first recorded
mention of (<i>a</i>) a Jointed Rod, and (<i>b</i>) Fishing with a Fly. The
former claim turns on the couplet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Aut crescente levis traheretur harundine præda,</span>
<span class="i2">Pinguis et implicitas virga teneret aves.”</span>
<span class="i35"><i>Ep.</i>, IX., 54, 3.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>For <i>levis</i> there are two other, though less well supported, readings,
viz. <i>vadis</i> and <i>velis</i>. Is <i>harundo</i> (literally a ‘reed,’ then a
‘rod,’ but used impartially to describe both the weapon of the fowler
and of the fisher) in these lines a fowler’s reed, or a fisher’s rod?
The answer, if indeed any be possible, depends on the precise meaning
to be attached to <i>crescente</i>, having regard to the context and the
whole epigram.</p>

<p><i>Crescente</i>, which some dictionaries, ignoring its use in a similar
connection in Silius Italicus, VII. 674-77, “sublimem calamo sequitur
crescente volucrem,” render <i>jointed</i>, can only here, I suggest, be
properly translated by <i>lengthening</i>, or <i>increasing</i>. But whether this
process of increasing was effected by real joints cannot be clearly
ascertained.</p>

<p>In his solitary note on <i>crescente</i> Valpy (Delphin edition, 1823)
vouchsafes the bald and not informative comment: “Vero mihi videtur
intelligenda esse virga quæ crescat in locis palustribus.”</p>

<p>The following explanation is interesting, but to my mind indecisive,
even though it claims the authority of “the old commentators.”<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
<i>Crescente</i>—“L’oiseleur caché sous un arbre rappelait les oiseaux
en imitant leur chant: puis, quand les oiseaux étaient sur l’arbre,
il allongeait le roseau enduit de glu, qu’il tenait à la main et les
oiseaux venaient s’y prendre. Le poëte dit que le roseau <i>croissait</i>,
parcequ’à mesure que l’oiseleur se hissait sur ses pieds, la baguette
engluée semblait croître en effet. Telle est la manière dont les
commentateurs anciens interprètent ce distique.”</p>

<p>Much again depends on whether we read <i>vadis</i> (shallows) or <i>levis</i>
(swift); <i>vadis</i> would incline the balance heavily, but not absolutely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
to the rod, not to the reed. We get no help from Friedländer, who contents
himself with a mere reference to Martial, <i>Ep.</i>, XIV. 218, quoted below.</p>

<p>Paley is of doubtful or little avail. He holds that <i>harundo</i> means
the fowler’s reed. The implement was so contrived that a smaller
reed, tipped with birdlime (<i>viscum</i>),<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
made from the cherries of the mistletoe, was suddenly protruded
(perhaps blown) through a thicker reed against a bird on its perch, and
that to this lengthening <i>crescente</i> refers. Cf. <i>Ep.</i>, XIV. 218.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Non tantum calamis, sed cantu fallitur ales,</span>
<span class="i2">Callida dum tacita crescit harundo manu.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The fowler attracted the attention of the bird as he approached it, by
imitating its note.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>Propertius refers to fowling (<i>Vertumnus</i>, V. 2, 33), and in Petronius
(<i>Sat.</i>, 109, 7) we find “volucres, quas <i>textis</i> harundinibus peritus
artifex tetigit.”<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> <i>Textis</i>
here, which Mr. Heseltine renders ‘jointed,’ would seem to show Paley’s
suggestion, that the first cane was hollow, while the second was
“protruded” through it, to be wrong.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>Rich explains this method of fowling as follows. The sportsman first
hung the cage with his call bird on the bough of a tree, under which,
or at some convenient distance from it, he contrived to conceal
himself. When a bird, attracted by the singing of its companion,
perched on the branches, he quietly inserted his rod amongst the
boughs until it reached his prey, which stuck to the lime and was thus
drawn to the ground. When the tree was very high, the rod was made in
separate <i>joints</i>, like our fishing rod, so that he could lengthen it
out until it reached the object of his pursuit, whence it is termed
<i>crescens</i> or <i>texta</i>.</p>

<p>If the example given by Rich (from a terra-cotta lamp) be faithfully
rendered, the joints in the rod are easily discernible.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But all question as to the existence of a jointed fowling rod is now
settled past peradventure by Pl. 24, Fig. 686, in the <i>Brit. Mus. Cat.
of Gr. and Rom. Lamps</i>, 1914. This shows an animal dressed in a hooded
cloak, holding in his right hand a length of fowling rod, and in his
left two spare lengths, trying to reach a tree on which sits a bird.
Mr. Walters, the editor of the catalogue, kindly informs me that Fig.
686 can no longer be regarded as that of <i>The Fox and the Grapes</i>.
Similar lamps shown in S. Loeschcke’s recent <i>Lampen aus Vindonissa</i>, <i>e.g.</i>
Pl. 12, No. 473, confirm the evidence of the Brit. Mus. lamp in every detail.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>Not a few editors, on the other hand, retain <i>vadis</i> in Martial’s
epigram, instead of <i>levis</i>, as evidently did Hay, the Scotch poet, in
translating the couplet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Could I a trout, now, with my angle get,</span>
<span class="i4">Or cover a young partridge with my net.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Much can be said for the view that line three applies to <i>fishing</i>. So
much, indeed, that were it not for one, apparently fatal, omission, we
might confidently proclaim <i>the first definite mention of a jointed
rod</i>. To this omission, conclusive to my mind of the meaning of
<i>harundo</i>, I have so far found no allusion.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the first line of the couplet does refer to
<i>fishing</i>. The poet would like to give some birds or fish, or both, to
his friend Carus, but bewails his inability to send anything better
than some chickens. He does explain fully why he cannot send birds, but
he omits entirely any reason, or even any hint, as to what prevents him
sending fish. We are not allowed to imagine that the weather was too
bad, for the whistling ploughman imitating the magpie in his call, the
starlings, the linnets, all negative that.</p>

<p>The whole epigram seems to refer to fowling. The application, even if
<i>vadis</i> for <i>levis</i> be adopted, would not necessarily be altered. Are
there not wild duck and snipe to be caught in the shallows (<i>vadis</i>) as
well as fish, and probably by other means than birdlime, though with
the use of a rod?</p>

<p>If <i>levis</i>, or even <i>vadis</i> be read, two arguments lean heavily against
<i>harundo</i> being the <i>fisher’s</i> Rod. The first, in a poem dealing
entirely with birds this somewhat obscure reference to fish would be
extremely abrupt; the second, the line following “harundine præda”
runs, “Pinguis <i>et</i>” (not “aut” as before) “implicitas virga teneret
aves,” “<i>and</i> (not or) the sticky reed-line,” etc.</p>

<p>Save for this omission and the trend of the whole context, a strong
argument might be easily advanced for <i>fishing</i> in the apparent
redundancy of <i>harundo</i> and <i>virga</i>. But these two words may refer to
two different weapons of capture, or, what is more probable, to two
different ways of catching <i>birds</i>—the first, by a long reed with a
noose, and the second by a branch with birdlime.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
To conclude, whether <i>harundo</i> here be a weapon for capture
of birds or of fish, it is now established beyond any doubt or
contradiction that there was used in and probably long before
Martial’s time<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
a <i>Reed Rod</i>, capable of extension, either by protruding a smaller cane
through a larger one, or else, perhaps, by an action somewhat similar
to a chimney-sweep’s, with jointed rods fastened together in the hand,
when prolonging his brush.</p>

<p>If such a Reed Rod was found of service to the fowler for
reaching a bird on a high branch, is it not extremely probable,
is it not almost certain, that in spite of no express mention of
such use the fisherman also employed a similar jointed rod for
the purpose—common alike to his primitive predecessor and
his more advanced successor—of getting the bait over any
obstacles which lay between him and the water, and for increasing
both the reach of his arm and the length of his throw?<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>Whether the Rod of the <i>piscator</i> was similar to that of the
<i>aucupator</i> or not, we do find these two pursuits, with but one
verb for both, coupled in two of Tibullus’s beautiful lines on
Hope (II. 6, 23). His Hope is very reminiscent of St. Paul’s
Charity or Love, which “beareth all things, believeth all things,
hopeth all things, endureth all things. Love never faileth.”</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class="h_subtitle">THE FIRST MENTION OF A FLY</span></h3></div>

<p>The first mention of fishing with a fly occurs apparently in Martial’s
lines, “Namque quis nescit, | Avidum vorata decipi scarum <i>musca</i>?”
which have been translated:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Who has not seen the scarus rise,</span>
<span class="i4">Decoyed, and killed by fraudful flies?”<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>These lines are of surpassing interest. In them we may possess the very
first mention of a fishing fly, whether natural or artificial, in all
the records written or depicted of the whole world.</p>

<p>If the reference be to an artificial fly, it certainly antedates by
some two centuries the passage of Ælian (XV. 1), which has hitherto
been universally acclaimed the first mention of such a fly. If on the
other hand the reference be to a natural fly, it antedates by the same
period of time the first mention of the natural fly, or rather winged
insect (κώνωψ), to be found also in Ælian (XIV. 22).</p>

<p>And here, pray, observe the cold calm of the classical commentator!
This passage, which, as I have said, may be the very first historical
document testifying to the use of the fly, the very first tiny
beginning of the immense literature consecrated to the fly, the very
first starting point in the fly fisher’s journey of sore travail to
farther knowledge, this passage so pregnant of possibilities and so
provocative of comment, has never, I believe, been suggested by any
editor as possibly the <i>locus classicus</i> of fly fishing, far prior to
the generally adopted passage of Ælian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>Even if we make great allowance for the wrath of the literary angler
at the careless indifference with which these lines appear from his
standpoint to be treated, the comments by the editors of Martial must
be classed, in other respects also, as unsatisfactory and jejune.</p>

<p>Paley and Stone, for instance, confine themselves to telling us that
“scarus is some unknown but highly prized fish, which was caught by an
inferior one used as bait.” That is all! nothing more! Their “unknown”
stamps their indifference, or ichthyic ignorance.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
Further, they never even hint that in this passage commentators have
suggested two readings, <i>musco</i>—‘moss,’ and <i>musca</i>—‘fly.’ They simply
adopt <i>musco</i> without hinting at any difficulty arising from such
adoption.</p>

<p>Friedländer adopts <i>musca</i>. His only note consists of, “Vorato—musco
wollte Brodæus lesen wegen der von Athenæus, VII., p. 319 f., aus
Aristoteles angeführten Stelle<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> ...”</p>

<p>The majority of editors<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
prefer, and probably rightly, the reading <i>musca</i> for many reasons,
the chief being that all the manuscripts of Martial without a single
exception give <i>musca</i>. The upholders of <i>musco</i>, in their endeavour to
enforce that mere conjecture by quoting from Athenæus, “The <i>Scarus</i>
flourishes on his food of seaweed,”<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
and supporting it by Pliny,<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
“The <i>Scarus</i> is said to be the only fish that ruminates and is
herbivorous” (and here note that as Pliny—like Athenæus—was taking his
information from Arist., <i>N. H.</i>, VIII. 2, he should have translated
φυκίοις by <i>algis</i>, not by <i>herbis</i>), make the mistake of translating
φυκίον by <i>muscus</i>. They ignore, moreover, Oppian, II. 649, φέρβονται
δ’ ἢ χλωρὸν ἁλὸς μνίον, κ.τ.λ. Φυκίον is, while <i>muscus</i> is not and
never has been, <i>algæ</i> or true seaweed; <i>muscus</i> is
‘moss.’<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Nor do these Olympian editors, who sit beside their proof-sheets, and
whose notes are ever hurled far below them in the valley, condescend to
explain to us poor gropers after light how moss to a sea-fish like the
<i>Scarus</i> can be of value as food.</p>

<p>Most fishermen will tell you that fresh-water fish do eat moss; that
they themselves have seen them in the act of eating such moss on the
Thames; that roach in especial are particularly fond of this moss,
which is used in summer months as a bait with great success; this moss
they call by various names, ‘silk weed,’ ‘flannel weed,’ ‘blanket
weed,’ and ‘crow-silk.’ Now all these so-called mosses are not mosses
at all, but belong to the family <i>Confervæ</i>, which are fresh-water green
<i>algæ</i>: so even in rivers we find that moss is not used as bait.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>That not only the <i>Scari</i> but other fish, <i>e.g.</i> the <i>Melanuri</i>, feed
on seaweed and that they are taken by baits composed of seaweed, many
writers besides Athenæus and Pliny duly record. Theocritus (<i>Id.</i>, XXI.
10) speaks of “baits of seaweed.” Oppian,<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
describing the manner of catching the <i>salpæ</i> by baiting a place with
stones covered with seaweed, states that when the fish have gathered
round this in numbers, “then prepares he (the fisher) the snare of the
weel.” Ælian<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
asserts that among the marine plants, on which he says fish feed, are
Βρύα ... καὶ φυκία ἄλλα, the difference between which seems according
to Aristotle merely one of size.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>If a poll of writers on Fishing and of practical Pisciculturists were
taken to-day, a large majority would vote that sea-fish do not eat
seaweed, but feed on the <i>larvæ</i>, and other minute insects in or on
the various <i>algæ</i> or seaweeds. But against this opinion is arrayed
the authority of Darwin and Wallace, who state that various species
of <i>Scarus</i> do browse, and do graze on seaweed, and some of them
exclusively on coral.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Skaros</i> (according to Aristotle) was the only fish which seemed
to ruminate,<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> whose food was seaweed,<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
and teeth, set in deep saw-edged jaws, were not sharp and interlocking,
like those of all other fish, but resembled those of a parrot, as its
beak resembled that of a parrot.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>From the <i>seeming</i> to ruminate of Aristotle we reach in later writers
like Oppian, I. 134 ff., and Ovid, <i>Hal.</i>, 119, the positive assertion
that the scarus <i>did</i> ruminate.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>Is it not possible, if a mere angler may hazard a suggestion
on scientific points, that the belief of modern writers and
pisciculturists is not far out, and that while some of the <i>Scari</i> do
browse and graze exclusively on coral, and some sometimes on seaweed,
they do this to obtain <i>as food</i> only the minute <i>larvæ</i>, which their
so-called rumination helps them to separate from the seaweed or
coral?<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>A second very practical argument against the reading <i>musco</i> suggests
itself. Let us allow that some sea fish do eat not only <i>algæ</i> but
moss: even then, why should our <i>Scarus</i> “be deceived” by the small
amount possible of attachment to a little hook, of seaweed or moss or
their <i>larvæ</i>? This is infinitesimal when compared with the greater
masses, giving immeasurably ampler supply of <i>larvæ</i>, growing in the sea.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Were it not for the incitement or excitement caused by the fly’s
movements or novelty, hardly a salmon, I venture to think, would
rise to a fly; but to our <i>scarus</i>, since <i>algæ</i> and moss (<i>if</i> the
latter exist in the sea of sufficient length) are familiar growths
and constantly set in motion by the action of the water, both these
incitements are surely lacking.</p>

<p>Even if neither of these arguments carries weight, the objection
brought forward by Gilbert appears to me to put the reading <i>musco</i>
out of court: “Suppose Martial knew what Athenæus and others state as
regards this peculiar habit of the scarus, surely this was not the
place, where the <i>Scarus</i> is introduced only as a representative of
all fish, to air his knowledge—least of all in words such as ‘quis
nescit.’”</p>

<p>In conclusion, if <i>musca</i> be the right reading, we can, I think,
definitely assert:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>A. That this passage contains the very earliest mention of a <i>fly</i>
being used for the taking of fish:</p>

<p>B. That from Martial’s employment of it as an illustration, and from
his not drawing attention to the novelty or oddness of such use,
and especially from the words “quis nescit,” which imply a general
knowledge, fly fishing had been long invented, and was a method common
among anglers:</p>

<p>C. That this solitary passage is inconclusive as to whether the fly was
simply a natural one attached to a hook, and used perhaps as now in
dapping,<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
or an artificial one.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
To my mind, however, the scale dips deeply in favour of the artificial
fly for the following reasons.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>1. The trend and purpose of the whole passage, especially when we
note carefully the preceding verse and a half, “<i>Odi dolosas munerum
et malas artes.</i> | <i>Imitantur hamos dona</i>,” is to inveigh against
fraudful gifts, typical of which fraudful flies are singled out—in
fact, against all presents which are not what they appear. Mr. A. B.
Cook writes: “I quite agree with your view that the passage gains much,
if all three lines are made to refer to an artificial fly with a hook
concealed in it. Indeed, that is pretty obviously the meaning.”</p>

<p>2. The difficulty which the ancients would have experienced in
impaling, etc., on one of their hooks a natural fly would have been
greater than dressing an artificial one. The smallest hook in the
Greek-Roman Collection at the British Museum (found at Amathus in
Cyprus 1894) measures over ¼ in. breadth at the bend.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
If we allow that owing to oxidation the metal may have coarsened and
swollen, the task of impaling, and further of fastening a natural fly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
securely enough to withstand the buffets of even wavelets of the sea
(for N.B. the <i>Scarus</i> is marine) must verily have demanded τὸν
δημιοεργόν, “a craftsman of the people, welcome over all the wide
earth.”<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>
</div>

<p>For these reasons the <i>kudos</i> of the first mention of an artificial
fly belongs, in my opinion, to Martial rather than to Ælian.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER X</h3>
<p class="center">THE SCARUS—THE EARLIEST ACCLIMATISATION OF
FISH—THE FIRST NOTICE “FISHING PROHIBITED”</p>
</div>

<p>From the wealth of copious yet conflicting accounts of this famous fish
in Greek and Roman writers, a large monograph might be produced.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
I restrict myself to a short notice of the acclimatisation of the fish,
and of the controversies on its value, as (A) a Dainty, and (B) a Diet.</p>

<p>The original habitat of the <i>Scarus</i> was in the seas off Asia Minor,
especially in the Carpathian Sea. During the Augustan age it was rarely
taken in Italian waters, and then only when driven thither by storms.
Thus Horace complains that neither Lucrine oysters nor <i>Rhombi</i> come
his way,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">“aut scari,</span>
<span class="i0">Si quos Eois intonata fluctibus</span>
<span class="i0">Hiems ad hoc vertat mare.”</span>
<span class="i14">(<i>Ep.</i>, II. 50 ff.)</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Pliny (IX. 29), after attributing to the <i>Scarus</i> the unique
characteristic of being herbivorous and <i>never</i> feeding on other
fish and asserting that of its own accord it never passes from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Carpathian Sea beyond Cape Troas, goes on to tell us that in the time
of Tiberius (or Octavius, according to Macrobius) vast quantities at
the Emperor’s command were collected by an Admiral of the Fleet and
planted along the Ostian and Campanian shores.</p>

<p>Careful protection by land and sea rendered poaching almost impossible.
For the period of five years any <i>scarus</i> caught in the nets had,
under heavy penalties, to be returned straightway to the water. The
enforcement of these wise regulations effected such mighty thriving of
the fish, that “postea frequentes inveniuntur Italiæ in litore, non
antea ibi capti; admovitque sibi gula sapores piscibus satis et novum
incolam mari dedit.”</p>

<p>This operation commands our comment, not merely on account of its big
success, but because it is the earliest and (as far as I can discover)
the only instance in all ancient literature, certainly in Greek and
Latin, of the acclimatisation of <i>fish</i> (not eggs) in the sea, and on a
large scale.</p>

<p>I do not include, though I do not forget, the large lucrative
planting of oysters in the Lucrine lake by Sergius Orata centuries
before.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>
Later on we shall read of the Romans carrying eggs, naturally
fertilised, from one water to another, and of the
Chinese<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
transporting vast quantities of similar eggs considerable distances.</p>

<p>But their methods and operations differed from the Emperor’s. Pliny
expressly states that the Admiral planted fish, not eggs of fish, in
the sea, not in fresh water, and in a new habitat hundreds of miles
from the old.</p>

<p>To this planting or involuntary colonisation, Petronius—seemingly,
despite controversy, the “Elegantiæ Arbiter,” or the not altogether
Admirable Crichton, of Tacitus—probably alludes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">“ultimus ab oris</span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Poets and <i>gourmets</i> have vied in singing the praises of the fish
as the daintiest of dishes—“according to the Greeks to do justice
to its flesh was not easy: to speak of its trail, as it deserved,
was impossible, and to throw away even its excrement was a sin.”
Confirmatory of Badham reads the pronouncement of <i>magnus ille et
subtilis helluo</i>, “that great and exquisite gourmet” Archestratus,
who from the grandiloquence and gravity of his Epic was evidently of
opinion <i>omne cum fidibus helluoni</i>!<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>Although Pliny (IX. 29) definitely asserts “Nunc scaro datur

fish as of poor flavour—its only redeeming point the trail,
which is excellent,</p>

In the curious and rare <i>Ichtyophagia</i> (the omission of the second
‘h’ of the theta may be a printer’s error) by the learned Doctor
Ludovicus Nonnius, published at Antwerp in 1616—a treasure-house from
which I quote much and take more—an attempt is made to explain these
diametrically opposed estimates. Nonnius asserts that as among the
common herd only those fish which have fat flesh find favour or yield
good flavour, and as the <i>Scarus</i> possesses a drier and more flaky
flesh, “a plebis illis palatis spernebatur.”</p>

<p>This deals a nasty knock to poor Martial, who plumed himself on his
taste as a gourmet, acquired (he fails to add) at the banquets and
entertainments of his patrician friends or wealthy patrons.</p>

<p>Medical controversy, rarely absent, as to wholesomeness for once
hardly exists. Galen, Diphilus, Xenocrates all agree as to the
<i>Scarus</i>, although the last warns us that it is “hard to pass off in
perspiration!” (δυσδιαφόρητος).<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>
Galen pronounces fish who haunt the rocks the most
wholesome<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>:
of these, the <i>Scarus</i> is by far the best. Diphilus the Siphnian on
the whole agrees, but condemns it as dangerous when fresh (!) because
it hunts and feeds on the poisonous sea-hare and so frequently causes
cholera morbus.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
But according to Ælian, IX. 51, the Mullet (τρίγλη) was held by the
initiates of the Eleusinian Mysteries in the greatest honour, for one
or other of two curious reasons: the first, because it brings forth its
young thrice a year<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>,
and second, because it eats the sea-hare, who bears death to
man.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>Nonnius (p. 81) informs us that the followers of Pythagoras were
forbidden to eat the <i>Scarus</i> because it was τρυγηφάγος, <i>i.e.</i> an
eater of grain or grapes, whence or how obtained he vouchsafes not to
inform us.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
It is of interest to read in Faber (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 27) that the common
seal (<i>Phoca vitulina</i>) is believed at the present time to go ashore in
the Ombla Valley in quest of <i>grapes</i> during the vintage, and is also
said to commit great havoc in the vineyards of Sardinia and Sicily!</p>

<p>But for once Nonnius naps! Although, according to tradition,
Pythagoras proscribed all fish, three kinds only are expressly and by
name forbidden (in Symbols 18, 19, 60), <i>viz.</i> the <i>Melanurus</i>, the
<i>Erythinius</i>, and the <i>Sepia</i>; nothing is said about the <i>Scarus</i>.</p>

<p>I presume that the error arose from Nonnius confusing a passage in
Plutarch (<i>Symp.</i>, VIII. 8, 3.) where <i>à propos</i> of Pythagoras,
τρυγηφάγος is associated with the <i>Scarus</i>, but in exactly the opposite
sense, “for we can <i>not</i> call the Mullet corn-destroying, or the
<i>Scarus</i> grape-eating,” etc.</p>

<p>Again our Nonnius! By a passage from Pliny, XXXII. 3, he attempts to
clear the <i>Scarus</i> and throw the blame for cholera on the Mullet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>But Pliny distinctly states that alone of all <i>animals</i> the fish called
the Mullet, when he can annex no other food, eats the sea-hare without
fatal consequences, after which he “tenerescit tantum et ingratior<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>
viliorque fit.” These Mullet, sold by fraudulent fishermen as <i>Scari</i>,
caused the indictment of Diphilus. Rondolet bears witness that near
Massilia similar sales took place “ab imperitis piscatoribus,” but
surely “too skilled” would be the better epithet. It is but fair to add
that Athen., VIII. 51, asserts that the <i>Scarus</i> also eats the sea-hare.</p>

<p>For this long discursus, the repute of the <i>Scarus</i>, the disputes of
epicures and of doctors whether it be a dainty, or a sound diet, and
the exclusive properties attributed to it by Greek and Roman writers
must be my excuse.</p>

<p>Summarising these last, we find that the <i>Scarus</i>, in addition to being
the most passionate in his love<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>,
<i>alone of all fishes</i>,</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>(A) Is not a cannibal, but a vegetarian (Pliny, IX. 29). Oppian claims
for the <i>mugil</i>—grey mullet—that it is the only non-carnivorous fish
(II. 642-3). Couch gives as his considered opinion, “<i>Mugil capito</i> is
the <i>only</i> fish of which I am able to express my belief that it usually
selects for its food nothing that has life.” Modern authorities have
established that the <i>scarus</i> feeds on molluscs also.</p>

<p>(B) Seems to ruminate or does ruminate.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
But Aristotle (and, of course, Pliny) hold that most, perhaps all, fish
do sleep, even if their eyelids are not closed: at any rate Tunnies
and all flatfish do, while Pliny (X. 97) goes as far as asserting that
“Dolphins and whales can be heard to snore!”</p>

<p>(F) Never deserts his fellow fish. If he have swallowed a bait, his
friends flock around him and liberate him by biting the line in two. If
he be caught in trap or weel, they approaching very delicately give the
prisoner the choice of (<i>a</i>) gripping with his teeth a tail “by which
he is dragged through the mesh of twigs,” or (<i>b</i>) of pushing through
his own tail, which they (outside) seize, and pull him through the weel
<i>backwards</i>—thus avoiding damage from the twigs to the eyes of the
captive.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This devotion to his imprisoned fellow was turned to good account by
fishermen. Fastening a hook in the jaw of and trailing a net behind
a female <i>scarus</i> (preferably alive) they secured large catches by
dropping the lead, which reversed the net and enmeshed the would-be
rescuers. With the seed of the coriander <i>Scari</i> are taken “with a
vengeance!”<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>Ælian (I. 4) concludes a similar story, probably purloined from Oppian,
for he was an adept in picking up unconsidered and unacknowledged
trifles, with, “These things do they, as men do: but to do loving-kindness
are <i>they</i> born, not taught”; which demonstrates that the invaluable
<i>Scarus</i> provides men, not only with a menu, but also a moral!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>If we cannot absolutely claim for Martial the first mention of the
jointed Fishing Rod and the natural or artificial Fly, we are safe
in acclaiming him the author of the first notice, “Fishing strictly
prohibited,” or “Chasse défendue,” in his</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Baiano procul a lacu recede,</span>
<span class="i4">Piscator: fuge, ne nocens recedas.”</span>
<span class="i24">(IV. 30.)</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This epigram furnishes Bunsmann with one of the only three acts of
<i>Impietas</i> which he can allege against the blameless race of fishermen.
Martial here solemnly warns a fellow craftsman against fishing in the
lake of Baiæ, because (1) the fish there are sacred to the Emperor
Domitian, (2) a previous intruder was smitten blind in the very act
of landing his fish, so that—and here comes a touch of the true
angler—“he could not <i>see</i> his spoil.”</p>

<p>The pretty compliment, veiled in the words “sacred fish,” ranks
Domitian as a god, because, as at many temples of the gods fish were
held sacred, so at his Baian abode the fish had been shown by divine
action to be sacred. But the fulsome bluntness of “than whom in the
whole world there is none mightier” mars the effect. Lest, however,
his friend might think that “Not twice in this world shall the Gods do
thus,” or deem the superhuman sanction played out, Martial adjures him to
throw to the fish some plain hookless food, and “dum potes, innocens recede.”</p>

<p>These Baian fish were evidently not as sophisticated or as
discriminating as their neighbours, the <i>Melanuri</i>, which greedily
snatch food thrown into the sea, but to any bit whatsoever containing a
hook they approach neither delicately, nor at all.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>In case some reader, fired by the fame of Theocritus or Martial,
imagine an easy affluence by writing Fisher Eclogues or Fisher
Epigrams, I refer him to Martial’s other warning, where he states that
a written copy of one of his books could be bought for about fourpence
halfpenny (considerably cheaper than a printed one now) and that with a
profit to the bookseller!<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
The seeming <i>naïveté</i> of Martial’s appeal to a buyer and of his
recommendation that the book, which describes presents, would be for a
man like himself not too flush of coin, an admirable present to send at
the Saturnalia, incites me to give the whole, if fishless, passage.</p>

<p>The hint of how to get rid of their surplus stock or “remainders” at
Christmas may avail our present poetasters in these days of economy
and war taxes. “The whole collection of <i>Xenia</i>” (distichs describing
certain kinds of viands so-called) “in this thin book will cost you
four sesterces to buy. Is four too much? You <i>may</i> get it (in a cheaper
form) for two, and even that will leave a profit to the bookseller.
This book itself, which describes presents, may be sent as a present at
the Saturnalia, if you have not much money to spare, like myself.”</p>

<p>Manuscript books at Rome cost even less than printed books do now. This
seeming inconsistency was effected by a large number of slaves writing
rapidly at the dictation of one person, and so multiplying copies very
cheaply and easily.</p>

<p>By such means, no doubt, was published <i>Acta Diurna</i>, the fly sheet
or daily newspaper of Rome. Composed originally of the reports of
lawsuits, births, deaths, marriages, and the almost equally numerous
divorces, it came to contain in the time of Julius Cæsar the debates
and <i>Acta</i> of the Senate, and later the news collected and conveyed by
constant couriers from all parts of the Empire.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p class="neg-indent">PLUTARCH: THE CHARGE AGAINST HIM OF CONTEMNING FISHING
QUITE FALSE—CLEOPATRA’S FISHING—OPPIAN—THE TORPEDO FOR GOUT—ATHENÆUS</p>
</div>

<p>Our next two authors, Plutarch (a little later than Martial) and Oppian
(<i>c.</i> 170 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), both wrote in Greek.</p>

<p>Plutarch for centuries has been misrepresented and maligned as an
opponent and contemptuous disdainer of fishing, but quite inaccurately.
I am not of the class of writers who invest Nero with a halo, or
canonise Clytæmnestra. I am no Knight of the Round Table on a quest to
redeem lost characters, but I feel it a duty and a pleasure on behalf
of Plutarch to fling down the glove and challenge his traducers to a
duel <i>à outrance</i>.</p>

<p>Modern English writers,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">“to the listening earth</span>
<span class="i0">Repeat the story,”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">but not, like the Moon, the story of “the birth” of their
error. Inevitably in their pages crop up Burton’s words, “Plutarch, in his
book <i>De Sol. Anim.</i>, speaks against all fishing as a filthy, base,
illiberal employment, having neither wit nor perspicacity in it, nor
worth the labour.”<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Holland translates the passage, “for the cowardice, blockishness,
stupidity, want of shifts and means in fishes, either offensive or
defensive, causes the taking of them to be dishonest, discommendable,
unlovely, and illiberal.” I subjoin the Greek so that each reader may
make his choice of or a translation of his own.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>These words do, it is true, occur in Plutarch’s <i>de Sol. Anim.</i>, 9.
But the chapter merely gives a fanciful report of an imaginary debate
before a jury empanelled to determine whether land or water animals
are the more crafty. The words embody, not the opinion, matured or
other, of the author, but one of the charges in the opening speech of
Aristotimus, who appears on behalf of the superior sagacity of the
terrestrials as against the aquatics.</p>

<p>From a sentence in the mouth of a special pleader Plutarch has been
branded for centuries, at any rate since the time of Burton’s book
(1621), as the foe of fishing and the maligner of the craft. And with
as much reason you might make Plato responsible for an opinion alien to
his nature but advanced by one of his dialecticians, or saddle Father
Izaak with some heresy of Venator’s.</p>

<p>An attempt to account for so learned and on the whole so fair an author
as Burton being led into a charge, the inaccuracy of which even cursory
perusal of chapter nine evinces, may, if fishless, yet interest some
of my readers. One of the blemishes ascribed to the <i>Anatomy</i> is the
burdening of the text with too profuse quotations, ransacked from not
only classical and patristic writers, but also (literally) from “Jews,
Turks, and Infidels.”</p>

<p>Making full allowance for Burton’s encyclopædic knowledge, whence,
and how, were these all amassed? Hearne, the Oxford historian, helps
towards an answer in his statement that Mr. John Rouse, of Bodley’s
Library, for many years provided his friend of Christ Church with
choice books and quotations. Is it too much to surmise that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
passages “provided” by the helpful service of Rouse<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>
—a trait fortunately still characteristic of his Bodley successors—included
the sentence of damnation, which, even if verified, was, from being torn
out of its context, certainly misunderstood and ill-digested?</p>

<p>One ought to be chary of attributing motives, much more so reasons;
but the only apparent reason for the numerous repetitions of Burton’s
slander must have been the line of least resistance or least exercise,
which deterred writer after writer from taking the trouble to consult
the original context and thus discovering by whom and how the words
were spoken. I have so far failed to find a single defender of Plutarch
on this count or any plea for reversal of a verdict based on evidence
wrongfully accepted.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>Indignation at the injustice of the charge waxes all the hotter, when
one remembers that the person indicted is the very self-same Plutarch
who stands out as our authority for much unique lore on fish, fishing,
and tackle. He, and no other, consoles the victims of an Emperor’s
decree of banishment by pointing out the happiness of their lot in
being far removed from the intrigues, the vices, the dust, the noise
of Rome to a fair Ægean island, where the sea breaks peacefully on the
rocks below, and—an additional assuagement—“where there is plenty of
fishing to be had!”</p>

<p>Could a man who contemned and denounced fishing so vigorously put into
the mouth even of the pleader for the superior craftiness of fish,
unless he himself had angled and possessed the true angling spirit,
the following sentences, as true and as useful to-day as when written
nineteen centuries ago?</p>

<p>“For the first and foremost, the cane of which the angle Rod is made,
fishers wish not to have big and thick, and yet they need such an
one as is tough and strong, for to pluck and hold the fishes, which
commonly do mightily fling and struggle when they be caught, but they
choose rather that which is small and slimmer, for fear lest if it
catch a broad shadow, it might move the doubt and suspicion that is
naturally in fishes.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>“Moreover, the line they make not with many water knots” (happy
anglers!), “but desire to have it as plain and even as possibly may
be, without any roughness, for that this giveth as it were some
denuntiation unto them of fraud and deceit. They take order likewise
that the hairs which reach to the hook should seem as white as possibly
they can devise, for the whiter they be the less are they seen in the
water for their conformity and likeness in colour to it.”<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>We anglers seem of a verity “nae gleg at the uptak.” After some 1650
years we find John Whitney, in the preface to <i>The Genteel Recreation:
or the Pleasure of Angling</i>, ascribing with modesty as to personal
prowess, but quiet pride as to discovery, his success very largely to
the use of “fine Tackling” which in the poem (!) he further, if in
barbarous verse, enforces,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Fineness in Angling’s th’ Anglers nearest Rule:</span>
<span class="i4">For Prudence must still regulate in all.”<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The sentence in his Preface is apposite to many a Preface, whether in
prose or verse. “As to the verse there is fault and folly enough, but
grant Poetical License, if in pleasing nobody I have pleased myself,
and that’s all the reward I desire,” for alas! to many of us writers
self-pleasing must be the sole reward of our desert, if not of <i>our</i> desire.</p>

<p>Misrepresentation as a despiser of fishing and fishermen has clutched
another victim, Dr. Johnson, of all people! As Plutarch has been
branded for an opinion not his own, so Johnson has been held guilty
of the famous libel—“A worm at one end and a fool at the other.”
The popular belief is all false. According to Boswell, he was very
appreciative—an attitude not always Johnsonian—of Walton’s work.</p>

<p>Again, it was no other than he<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>
who urged Moses Browne to bring out in 1750 a new edition—the fifth
and last was published in 1676—of <i>The Compleat Angler</i>, of which his
criticism, “a mighty pretty book,” hardly indicates contempt for its
subject, or author, whose life he once meant writing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>On Voltaire also the Worm-Fool libel has also been saddled, but
wrongly. To another Frenchman, Martial Guyet, it has been attributed,
but not convincingly.</p>

<p>In <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 3rd series, X. 472, can be found the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Messieurs, je suis pêcheur, et pêcheur de la ligne,</span>
<span class="i4">J’en fait ici l’aveu. Ce cas semble peu digne</span>
<span class="i4">De vos graves esprits: car on l’a dit souvent</span>
<span class="i4">La ligne, avec sa canne, c’est un long instrument</span>
<span class="i4">Dont le plus mince bout tient un petit reptile,</span>
<span class="i4">Et dont l’autre est tenu par un grand imbécile!”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>“These lines were written by Guyet, who if he were Martial Guyet died
nearly one hundred years before the great lexicographer was born.”<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>
Even before Guyet the libel seems to have become hackneyed, “<i>car on
l’a dit souvent</i>.”</p>

<p>Plutarch’s works figure so frequently in these pages that I will not
here specially dwell on or quote from them, except “once more the tale
to tell” of Antony and Cleopatra’s fishing as given in his <i>Life of Antony</i>, 29, 2.</p>

<p>Antony (who “fishes, drinks, and wastes the lamps of night in revel”),
when with Cleopatra on the Nile had, of course, if Beaumont and
Fletcher’s lines hold, not been half as successful as his mistress:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“She was used to take delight, with her fair hand</span>
<span class="i4">To angle in the Nile, where the glad fish,</span>
<span class="i4">As if they knew who ’twas sought to deceive them,</span>
<span class="i4">Contended to be taken.”<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>To shine in her eyes, he secretly commanded his diver to
attach fish to his hook. Cleopatra, becoming aware of the trick,
signalled her diver to go down (or as some others relate, bribed
Antony’s own servants) to affix to his hook, a <i>salted</i> fish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
(τάριχος). This he promptly struck and hauled out mid laughter and
ridicule. “Leave,” cried Cleopatra, “leave the fishing rod to us; your
game is Cities, Provinces, and Kingdoms.”<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>Shakespeare makes Cleopatra’s diver attach the salted fish:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Cleo</i>: Give me mine angle, we’ll to the river: there,</span>
<span class="i6">My music playing far off, I will betray</span>
<span class="i6">Tawny finn’d fishes; my bended hook shall pierce</span>
<span class="i6">Their slimy jaws, and as I draw them up,</span>
<span class="i6">I’ll think them every one an Antony,</span>
<span class="i6">And say ‘Ah, ha! you’re caught.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Charmian</i>:<span class="ws9">’Twas merry when</span></span>
<span class="i6">You wager’d on your angling; when your diver</span>
<span class="i6">Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he</span>
<span class="i6">With fervency drew up.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Cleo</i>:<span class="ws9">That time!—O times!—</span></span>
<span class="i6">I laughed him out of patience, and that night</span>
<span class="i6">I laugh’d him into patience; and next morn,</span>
<span class="i6">Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>We owe most of our knowledge as to the technical methods, the varying
minutiæ, and the numerous materials employed by the Greeks and Latins
in Fishing and Angling, to Oppian, to Ælian, Pliny the Elder, and
Plutarch.</p>

<p>“Bearing somewhat the same relationship to Eclogues of Fishermen that
Virgil’s Georgics do to those of Shepherds, were the Greek verse
treatises on fish and fishing. No fewer than six didactic Epics of
the sort were composed, but only that of Oppian is extant in complete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
form.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
It is written in hexameter, and combines material based on observations
with much extraordinary information gathered from floating material.
In the last part of the treatise, the accounts given of the methods of
capturing fish by men on various coasts lend a few pictures akin to
independent Idylls.”</p>

<p>“Most of the poem, however, is very like Pliny’s <i>Natural History</i>, put
into verse. These didactic poems, as a whole, have little relationship
with the Piscatory Eclogue, other than that implied in the fact that
they are written in verse and tell much about the practices of fishers.”</p>

<p>This grudging estimate of Oppian by Mr. Hall contrasts strangely with
the terms of highest eulogy which authors of all ages have bestowed
on him. Scaliger calls him “a divine and incomparable poet.” Sir
Thomas Browne bewails with wonder that “Oppian’s elegant lines are so
much neglected: surely we hereby reject one of the best epic poets.”
Scaliger remarks that no author makes more frequent use than Oppian of
similes, which he praises warmly for their strength and beauty, for
their brilliancy and effect.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion they occur far too frequently and regularly. If
we do not come across one at least in every hundred lines, the effect
is agreeable disappointment. The subjects of comparison, moreover, are
conventional and limited.</p>

<p>But Oppian’s poems were held in the very highest favour, not only
by our stingy stepmother, Posterity, but by his contemporaries. The
Emperor (whether he were Antoninus—of all the Emperors<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
perhaps the keenest fisherman—Caracalla, or Severus is not clear, as Oppian’s
exact date is still unsettled<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>),
on hearing the author recite his verses revoked the decree of
banishment on Oppian’s father (to Malta), and paid the poet a golden
<i>stater</i>, or more than a guinea a verse.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
With this very liberal payment by piece or verse-work may be contrasted
the treatment meted out to the great Persian poet Firdausi by the
Emperor Mahmud.</p>

<p>The most romantic of the versions of the story makes the latter promise
a <i>miskal</i> (or something less than ¼ oz.) for every couplet of the
former’s epic, <i>Shah Nameh</i>. On the poem’s arrival at Court, joy
reigned till discovery that it contained some 60,000 couplets.</p>

<p>Aghast at the amount, Mahmud or his Chancellor of Exchequer took
advantage of some ambiguity in the terms and, despite the protests of
Firdausi that the largesse was promised in <i>gold</i>, made payment in
<i>silver</i>. It chanced that the treasure arrived while the author was
in the public baths at Tús; furious at the fraud, he gave 20,000 to the
bathkeeper, 20,000 to the refreshment seller, and 20,000 to the camel
driver who had brought the bags of bullion.</p>

<p>Many years after, the Emperor, either repenting him of his broken word
or moved by reports of the great poverty in which the poet had long
lived, dispatched the sum in <i>gold</i>, or, as some say, indigo. Alas! as
the convoy entered Tús by the Rudbar gate, by that of the Razan was
Firdausi being borne to his grave.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>At the death of Oppian in his thirtieth year, the citizens of his
native place in Cilicia erected a statue to his memory. It bore the
most laudatory of inscriptions, of which the last two lines have been
Englished—“All” (<i>i.e.</i> preceding poets)</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“All the inspired him their chief allowed</span>
<span class="i4">And all to him their humbler laurels bowed,”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
—to which halting and involved translation we at least neither bow
laurels nor doff hats.</p>

<p>The <i>Halieutica</i> is divided into five books. The first two treat of
the natural history of fishes, the other three of the art of fishing.
Despite this proportion of space, fish rather than fishermen are the
heroes of the scenes. The work displays considerable knowledge of
zoology, coupled with absurd fables, which are adduced as grave matters
of fact.</p>

<p>In the fulness with which he enumerates the various kinds of fish,
and methods of fishing, the technique, the weapons, the materials
appropriate to each, Oppian stands pre-eminent among our authors. Nor
need we wonder at this fullness of treatment. He was wedded heart and
soul to all pertaining to fish, or fishing, which he calls the “lovely art.”</p>

<p>The kinds of fish mentioned by this “poeta doctissimus”<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
number, according to Bishop Hieronymus, one hundred and fifty-three.
This figure is verified by Ritter, who adds that “Pliny’s long list
contains only twenty-three more, <i>i.e.</i> one hundred and seventy-six
in all,” a total which hardly warrants the naturalist’s triumphal
outburst, “In the sea and in the ocean, vast as it is, there exists by
Hercules! nothing that is unknown to us, and a truly marvellous feat
it is that we are best acquainted with those things which Nature has
concealed in the deep.”<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>From the only English translation of the <i>Halieutica</i> (made in 1722
by Diaper and Jones, Fellows of Balliol) I take a few passages
illustrating the character and methods of Oppianic fishing.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>The latter at once arrest our attention by their modernity. They are
practically ours. Apostolides in his work describing fishing in modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Greece states that “les quatre engins d’Oppien, les filets, les
hameçons, les harpons et les nasses,” with the addition of “les claies
de roseau, d’importation romaine sans doute,” are the weapons of Hellas
in the present day. The tricks of Oppian prevail in the Peloponnese:
to-day, as nearly two millenniums back, the <i>Scarus</i> and the Mullet are
caught by using the female as decoy.</p>

<p>The procedure of taking the Octopus (which Aristotle pictures for us in
IV. 8), “when clinging so tightly to the rocks that it cannot be pulled
off, but remains attached, even when the knife is employed to sever it:
and yet if one employ fleabane (κόνυζα) to the creature, it drops off
at once,” remains the same in Greece to-day. Apostolides writes (p.
50), “Comme on voit, non seulement le procédé de pêche aux poulpes a
persisté jusqu’à nos jours, mais la plante (Conyse) qu’on emploie à cet
effet porte encore le même nom.”</p>

<p>But as Canning called into existence a new world to redress the balance
of power in the old, so too the Attic fisherman to dislodge the Octopus
has, Raleigh-like, imported to the aid of his old herb, American
tobacco.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>The devices for fishing, which in Oppian, I. 54-5, are—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“The slender-woven Net, Viminious Weel,<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></span>

<p class="no-indent">are amplified in III. 73 ff. in number and detail.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<span class="i4">Four sorts of fishers are distinct assigned.</span>
<span class="i4">The first in Hooks delight: here some prepare</span>

<span class="i4">A third prevails by more compendious ways,</span>

</div></div></div>

<p>We then pass to fishing by Nets, <i>Mazy Weel</i>, and Spears or Tridents.
A spirited passage, spoilt in the translation by superfluous verbiage,
sings of nocturnal fishing with spears and an attracting light. The
method probably obtained the world over, certainly in China, Rome, and
Greece, where Plato (<i>Soph.</i>, 220 D.) classes it under the heading
πυρευτική next to Angling. In Scotland it prevailed extensively, if
illegally, as <i>Burning the Water</i>, or <i>Leistering</i>, a Norse term, and
practice which Thor himself did not disdain. A passage from a lost
comedy—<i>The Trident</i>—perhaps by Philippides, shows a fisher armed
with a three-pronged fork and horn-lantern off a-Tunnying.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>The lines ring as true to-day as when Oppian<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>

<p class="no-indent">rents the world over would speedily abate, and many a river would know
its tenant no more.</p>

<p>For reading “at lairge” Oppian is admirable. At one moment you are
enjoying a vivid and passably accurate account (III. 149 ff.) of how
the Cramp or Torpedo Fish (νάρκη), like Brer Fox, lies low in the sand
and the mud, but on a sudden “ejects his poisoned charms” with such

<p>A fish stupefied by the shock is likened (II. 81 ff.) unto a man who in
dreams tries to escape from the threatening phantoms, only to find his
knees bound and his limbs incapable of flight.</p>

<p>The peculiar powers of the Torpedo Fish command some comment. Ancient
authors galore, to whom, in the absence of the more powerful electric
Eel of Central America, the νάρκη must have appeared an amazing
creature, have written and differed about it. Aristotle had early noted
that it caught its prey by means of a stupefying apparatus in its
mouth, or rather at the back of its head. Claudian asks (<i>Carm. Min.
Corp.</i>, XLIV. (XLVI.) 1 f.):</p>

Plato compares Socrates to the fish from his capability of electrifying
his audience in the strict, but not in the corrupt present-day sense of
the word, as some writers imagine. The comparison to the fish in <i>Meno</i>
80<span class="smcap">A</span> illustrates the benumbing effect of the Socratic
method on the thought and talk (τὴν ψυχὴν καὶ τὸ στόμα ναρκῶ) of Meno (and
others), so that he was μεστὸς ἀπορίας, and reduced to silence (οὐκ ἔχω ὅ
τι ἀποκρίνωμαι).</p>

<p>If limited to the electric fire which flashed from his eyes, the
comparison is complimentary to the philosopher, but, if applied to
the whole face, is, even if true, quite the reverse. The thirty odd
busts still extant of Socrates hand down to us an ugly, flat face with
pig’s-eyes, all characteristic of the <i>Torpedo narke</i>.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>Ælian (IX. 14) indulges in wondrous stories gleaned from his mother
and <i>viris peritis</i> of the permeation of the electric shock. Did one
but touch the net in which the fish was taken, lo! he was cramp-bound.
If some enquiring observer placed a pregnant torpedo in a vase of
sea-water, his fate, did but a drop fall on leg or arm, was similar,
but the fish, even though this virtue had gone out of her, in due
season became a mother!</p>

<p>According to Mr. Lones, Oppian, Ælian, to whom (V. 37) we owe the
specific for immunity when handling the fish, <i>viz.</i> “the liquor of
Cyrene,” Theophrastus, all exaggerate the powers of the Torpedo.</p>

<p>A most interesting account is given in Athenæus (VII. 95), who avers
that the shock was not produced by all parts of the fish’s body, but by
certain parts only, and that Diphilus of Laodicea had proved this by a
long series of experiments.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>
According to Galen and Dioscorides the shock, whence or however
obtained, relieved chronic headache, while a contemporary of the
latter recommends a person suffering from gout in the feet to stand
“bare-legged” on the shore, and apply the Torpedo.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>As the German and Austrian watering places are still under a cloud,
we may yet see on the shores of Italy bands of gouty and passionate
pilgrims standing bare-legged, awaiting the cure of the νάρκη!</p>

<p>Complaints of gout are rife, even among our fish-affecting
epigrammatists. From Hedylus, a singer rather of wine than of fish, we
trace the lineage of the disease, “of Bacchus the limb-loosener, and
of Venus the limb-loosener, is sprung a daughter, a limb-loosener, the
Gout”!<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>As to spawning, every author from Herodotus down to Izaak Walton has
evolved various but mostly inaccurate theories. Oppian (I. 479 ff.)
lays down that, as the passion of Love overcomes fish, the bodies of
the male and female meet in the water and “exude mingled slime,” which
swallowed by the female produces conception. To this (I. 554 ff.)
he allows an exception in the case of the <i>murænæ</i>. These mate with
land serpents, “who for a time lay aside their venom”: a monstrous
connection which finds affirmation by Sostratus<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>

about the <i>Naucrates ductor</i> or pilot fish (whence its name of

its affection and services from the whale to the shark, compels quotation:</p>

Some of Oppian’s best bits contain animated portraits of sea-fights.
The combatants are as intensely personified as Homer’s Greeks and
Trojans in their hand-to-hand fight on the banks of the Scamander. But
unlike the Heroes, the belligerents of Oppian pull each other to pieces
without any responsibility on their part, or shock to moral sense on
ours:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>In proportion as fish, which according to the earliest authors was
despised or disregarded, grew in favour with the Greeks, the frequency
of its mention in Greek literature increased apace.</p>

<p>The <i>Deipnosophistæ</i> by Athenæus, to which belongs the distinction
of being one of the earliest collections of <i>Ana</i>, is a curious sort
of philosophers’ feast. It quotes from nearly every writer on nearly
every topic; it discusses almost every conceivable subject, especially
gastronomy. It weighs the qualities of all things edible. Comments on
fish, taken from plays, histories, treatises, etc., are plentifully, if
incongruously, scattered.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>Everything goes in this work; grammatical problems are mixed up with
gastronomic; the discursiveness of Athenæus races from grave to gay,
grim death to any story, however apparently disconnected.</p>

<p>His tale of the <i>Pinna</i> (III. 46), a bivalve shellfish, and the
Pinnothere (a small crab who inhabits the shell of the <i>Pinna</i>)
resembles many of the fables current among the West Indian negroes as
regards the cleverness of the Crab. As soon as the small fish, on which
the <i>Pinna</i> subsists, have swum within the shell side, the Pinnothere
nips the <i>Pinna</i> as a signal to him to close his shell and secure them.</p>

<p>Plutarch (<i>De Sol. Anim.</i>, 30) shows that the habit was not entirely
altruistic, for “this being done, they feed together upon the common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
prey.” From the <i>Pinna</i> which haunts the bottom of the sea. From the
<i>Pinna</i> which haunts the bottom of the sea came ”the most transparent
pearls, very pure and very large.”<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p>The enormous industry of Athenæus, who (VIII. 15) speaking of the
materials he had amassed for this one book, casually states that he
himself “had read and made extracts from 800 plays of the Middle Comedy
<i>alone</i>,” and in it cites nearly 800 authors, and over 1200 separate
books, has undoubtedly preserved to us many valuable passages of the
ample literature and numerous plays in which fishermen once figured.
My many quotations from and references to his <i>Deipnosophistæ</i> make it
unnecessary to deal with this author<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>

Whether as a Naturalist Ælian possesses any value, whether his work
is “scrappy and gossiping, and largely collected from older and
more logical writers,”<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>
or “from the industry displayed, despite deficiency in arrangement,
a valuable collection in Natural History,” to us fishermen matters
little, for unto him has been ascribed the great glory of being the
first author of all ages and of all countries specifically to mention
and roughly describe an Artificial Fly.</p>

<p>And not only is he the first, but also (with possibly one exception)
the only author during fourteen hundred years, who makes any reference
to any such fly.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>
From Ælian until the <i>Treatyse of Fysshynge with an Angle</i> we find no
mention of, or allusion to, the Artificial Fly, but that it was well
known as a method of angling is easily deduced from the authoress’s
abrupt introduction of the subject, “There ben the xij flies or
dubbes with which ye shall angle.”<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>The usually accurate <i>Bibliotheca Piscatoria</i> of Westwood and Satchell
states under heading of ‘Ælian,’ that Stephen Oliver (Mr. Chatto), in
his <i>Scenes and Recollections of Fly Fishing</i>, <i>first</i> pointed out this
remarkable passage. Now the first edition of Oliver’s book is dated
1834; so, if the <i>Bibliotheca Piscatoria</i> be correct, Ælian’s statement
apparently remained unknown to Anglers for nearly eighteen centuries.</p>

<p>I purposely set out a translation of the whole passage in Ælian, XV.
1, because short extracts are usually given, and because these vary
greatly on a very important point. I adopt with some alterations the
translation by Mr. O. Lambert in his <i>Angling Literature in England</i> (1881).</p>

<p>“I have heard of a Macedonian way of catching fish, and it is this:
between Bercea and Thessalonica runs a river called the Astræus, and in
it there are fish with speckled skins; what the natives of the country
call them you had better ask the Macedonians. These fish feed on a fly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
peculiar to the country, which hovers on the river. It is not like
flies found elsewhere, nor does it resemble a wasp in appearance, nor
in shape would one justly describe it as a midge or a bee, yet it has
something of each of these. In boldness it is like a fly, in size you
might call it a midge, it imitates the colour of a wasp, and it hums
like a bee. The natives generally call it the <i>Hippouros</i>.</p>

<p>“These flies seek their food over the river, but do not escape the
observation of the fish swimming below. When then the fish observes
a fly on the surface, it swims quietly up, afraid to stir the water
above, lest it should scare away its prey; then coming up by its
shadow, it opens its mouth gently and gulps down the fly, like a
wolf carrying off a sheep from the fold or an eagle a goose from the
farmyard; having done this it goes below the rippling water.</p>

<p>“Now though the fishermen know of this, they do not use these flies at
all for bait for fish; for if a man’s hand touch them, they lose their
natural colour, their wings wither, and they become unfit food for the
fish. For this reason they have nothing to do with them, hating them
for their bad character; but they have planned a snare for the fish,
and get the better of them by their fisherman’s craft.</p>

<p>“They fasten red (crimson red) wool round a hook, and fix on to the
wool two feathers which grow under a cock’s wattles, and which in
colour are like wax. Their rod is six feet long, and their line is the
same length. Then they throw their snare, and the fish, attracted and
maddened by the colour, comes straight at it, thinking from the pretty
sight to get a dainty mouthful; when, however, it opens its jaws, it is
caught by the hook and enjoys a bitter repast, a captive.”</p>

<p>The lines which describe the making up of the fly—τῷ ἀγκίστρῳ
περιβάλλουσιν ἒριον φοινικοῦν, ἤρμοσταί τε τῷ ἐρίῳ δύο πτερὰ
ἀλεκτρυόνος ὑπὸ τοῖς καλλαίοις πεφυκότα καὶ κηρῷ τὴν χρόαν
προσεικασμένα<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>
are translated in Westwood and Satchell’s <i>Bibl. Pisc.</i>, and by
Mr. Lambert quite differently.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <i>Bibl. Pisc.</i>:</p>

<p class="blockquot1">“Round the hook they twist scarlet wool, and
two wings are secured on this wool from the feathers which grow under
the wattles of a cock, brought up to the proper colour with wax.”</p>

<p>In Lambert:</p>

<p class="blockquot1">“They fasten red wool round a hook and fit on
the wool two feathers which grow under a cock’s wattles, and which in
colour are like wax.”</p>

<p>It is asserted in the <i>Bibl. Pisc.</i> that the whole passage is therein
“for the first time, accurately, translated,” but this proud boast
must take a back seat, for Mr. Lambert translates with far nearer
accuracy. One grave error springs from mistranslation in the former of
προσεικασμένα as “brought up to,” instead of “like,” a meaning very
common in Greek writers of the second and third century.</p>

<p>But, apart from the question which of the two be the better rendering,
no doubt whatever can exist which of the flies described would be found
the better, if not the only, killer. Application of wax to the hackles
of a cock would certainly cause the fibre to stick together, entirely
destroy their free play in the water, and render them useless as wings.</p>

<p>This passage, ever since its rediscovery by Oliver in 1834, has been
acclaimed by most writers on Fishing as (A) being the first instance
in literature, or for that matter in art, of the Artificial Fly, and as
(B) ascribing to the Macedonians the credit of a “new invention” in Angling.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly the first and only express mention of a specially
made-up Artificial Fly down to 500 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and probably even
down to Dame Juliana’s Book (<i>c.</i> 1500). But I suggest and believe that
this passage is intended, not as a description of a “new invention,”
or of a striking departure from old methods of Angling. It merely
instances the Macedonian’s adaptability to his environment, and his
imitative skill in dressing from his wools and feathers a fly to
resemble as closely as possible the natural fly on which the fish were
feeding, a practice very common among anglers of the present day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>So far from the Artificial Fly being a “new invention,” it seems to me
to have been for a long time in more or less regular use. The materials
necessary or employed for dressing flies are set forth in two other
places by Ælian in this same work. The Macedonian fly is described at
length and in special detail, probably because it marked an advance in
making up a fly.</p>

<p>I have not been able so far to find the passages in Bk. III. 43, and
Bk. XV. 10, mentioned (except in Blümner’s general list of fishing
weapons under “<i>Fischfang</i>”<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>)
or alluded to in connection with fly-making, much less brought into the
prominence which their special pertinence of a surety deserves and demands.</p>

<p>This omission may be due to previous writers being content with the
authority and researches of Oliver and of Westwood and Satchell, and on
the line of least exertion not pursuing the subject any further even
in the pages of Ælian himself. If they had so pursued, they would have
discovered in the first passage in Bk. XII. 43, which is separated by
only three books, and in the second passage in Bk. XV. 10, which is
separated by only nine chapters from the <i>locus classicus</i> in Bk. XV.
1, strong reasons for qualifying their statement as to the Macedonian
“invention.”</p>

<p>In Bk. XII. 43, Fishing is divided into four kinds—by Nets, Spears,
Weels, and Hooks; that by hooks (ἀγκιστρεία) is adjudged “the most
skilful, and the most becoming for free men,” that by Weels (κυρτεία)
the least so. In each class Ælian carefully enumerates the articles
necessary or generally used.</p>

<p>The list of those necessary for fishing with hooks, or Angling,
recounts “natural horse-hair, white, and black, and flame-coloured, and
half-grey; but of the dyed hair, they select only those that are grey,
or of true sea-purple, for the rest, they say, are pretty poor. They
use, too, the straight bristles of swine, and thread, and much copper
and lead, and cords.” Now follow the important words—“and feathers,
chiefly white, or black, or various. They use two wools, red and
blue.”<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>Further requirements are “corks, and wood, and iron, and of things
they need, are reeds well-grown, and nets, and soaked rushes, a shaved
wand, and a dog-wood Rod, and the horns and hide of a she-goat.” The
equipment is as ample as amazing. What use, in the name of every
fishing Deity, unless the author is referring to Oppian’s method, did
the <i>Angler</i> make of the “horns and hide of a she-goat”?</p>

<p>Ælian concludes with ἄλλος δὲ ἄλλῳ τούτων ἰχθὺς αἱρεῖται, which
antedates the tale of the millionaire, who, reproached with having
brought a thousand times too many flies, ejaculated, “with some of
these, if I can’t get a salmon, maybe I’ll strike a sucker”!</p>

<p>In XV. 10, which deals with the capture of pelamyde or young tunny
fish, one of the crew sitting at the stern lets down on either side of
the ship lines with hooks. On each hook he ties a bait (perhaps not a
bait in our modern technical sense, but rather a lure) wrapped in wool
of Laconian red, and to each hook attaches the feather of a seamew.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>Let us set aside, because of Ælian’s haphazard method of arrangement,
any argument which might otherwise fairly be adduced from the following
facts. (A) He expressly sets forth in XII. 43 (three books before he
mentions the Macedonian device) <i>red and other wools and feathers</i> as
part of the <i>ordinary tackle</i> of an Angler—most probably in river or
lake, for here, unlike XV. 10, where the prey is a sea-fish, we have no
mention of a ship, oars, etc. (B) When he does mention the Macedonian
device, he does not announce it in any way as a new invention or a
striking departure from the old methods of fishing, but quite simply, in the
words: “I have heard of the Macedonian way of fishing, and it is this.”</p>

<p>Setting aside, I repeat, any arguments thus to be deduced, we are face
to face with the hard and curious fact, that in all three passages the
materials, out of which the lures are constructed, <i>are the same</i>; they
are wools of various colours, and feathers taken from birds, in XV. 1,
from a cock, in XV. 10, from a seamew.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>Any assertion or suggestion that these wools and feathers were
used, and are specially stated to have been used for tying only the
Macedonian fly, and that this special statement of such uses is meant
expressly to differentiate the Macedonian from all other ways of
fishing, and thus constitutes the first mention of an Artificial Fly, I
counter by a couple of queries.</p>

<p>Why in XII. 43, and XV. 10, are these self-same wools and feathers
set out among the necessary ordinary requisite tackle of a fisherman,
if they were not used for dressing a fly, perhaps more primitive but
still Artificial? And, if they were not so used, to what other fishing
purpose can they be fairly applied?</p>

<p>Again, let us for a moment grant that the Macedonian device was the
absolutely new invention or the striking departure from all preceding
angling methods, which, had artificial flies not previously been
well known, it most certainly would have been. In this case, surely
Ælian, meticulous in his examination and classification of the tackle,
etc., needed for each of the four stated kinds of fishing, would have
employed, when about to tell of this invention, words calling more
instant attention to and far worthier of this great revolution than the
simple, “I have heard of the Macedonian way of fishing, and it is this”!</p>

<p>As supporting my contention, a further point must be noted. In the list
of tackle in XII. 43, wools and feathers are mentioned in a general
manner, but in XV. 1, their use is particularised and elaborated.
Similarly in the first passage the making and material of Rods are
given, but in the second (and here only) the particular length of rod
is stated.</p>

<p>It is on these passages (XII. 43, and XV. 10) and on their natural
implication, that I chiefly found my conclusion that (A) the practice
of making up and fishing with some kind of artificial fly had been in
more or less general use for a long time previous to the Macedonian
device, and (B) that the device is quoted merely as an instance of a
special, local, and improved adaptation of such usage—in a word as <i>le
dernier cri</i> in flies!<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>If in Martial (<i>Ep.</i>, V. 18. 8) <i>musco</i>, not <i>musca</i>, should be read,
then to Ælian would belong the credit of being the first to mention not
only the use of the artificial fly, but also the use of the natural fly.</p>

<p>In XIV. 22, we read of the <i>Thymalus</i> (a kind of grayling), which alone
of all fishes gives out after capture no fishy smell, but rather so
fragrant an odour that one would almost swear that in his hand he held
a freshly gathered bunch of thyme (“that herb so beloved by bees”),
instead of a fish. Ælian then lays down that, while it is easy to
catch this fish in nets, it is impossible to do so with a hook baited
with <i>anything</i> except theκώνωψ, <i>i.e.</i> the gnat, or more
probably from the vivid description by one who has evidently suffered,
the mosquito, “that horrid insect, a foe to man, both day and night,
alike with his bite and his buzz.”<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>Here then, in XIV. 22, we get, if the conjecture <i>musco</i> should be held
to deprive Martial of his priority, the first mention of angling with a
<i>natural</i> fly.</p>

<p>The difficulty, obvious at once to the practical angler, of how the
ancients (or even the moderns with all the elaborate perfections of
Redditch) could manufacture a hook little enough to impale a mosquito
did not escape Aldrovandi.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>
But the κώνωψ, said to spring from the σκώληκες, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>larvæ</i>
found in the sediment of vinegar, was apparently even smaller than
his brother mosquito, the ἐμπίς.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p>As only with great care, and even then only on very fine wire, can the
smallest modern hook, No. 000, be coaxed to impale a big gnat, the
problem before the Ancients of impaling with a hook one, and this not
even the largest, of the mosquito tribe seems insoluble. But perhaps
Ælian’s κώνωψ (as probably also his ἵππουρος) was far larger than its
descendant of the present day, or perhaps our author has substituted by
mistake the mosquito for some larger but similar gnat.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">AUSONIUS—SALMO, SALAR AND FARIO—FIRST MENTION OF THE PIKE</span></h3></div>

<p>Ausonius (<i>c.</i> 310-<i>c.</i> 393 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) is practically
the last Latin writer within my time-limit (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 500)
who has allusions of interest to Fishing. In the fifth century, however, Sidonius,
whose fishing and hunting interest apparently equalled his diocesan—<i>his</i>
‘Nolo Episcopari’ was, if fruitless, at once exceptional and genuine,
for the see of Clermont had to be forced on his acceptance—tells us in
a letter and in his poems of the catching of fish, especially by night
lines in a lake on his wife’s property in the Auvergne.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>The tenth Idyll of Ausonius (“Ad Mosellam,” a great favourite with
Izaak Walton), ranks, according to Mackail, “the writer not merely as
the last or all but last of Latin, but also as the first of French
poets.” It demands mention, quite apart from the vividness of its
pictures, because it is the only fisher poem of any length in classical
Latin, and because in it occurs the first mention of the <i>Salar</i> and
the <i>Fario</i>.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Salmo</i> Pliny three hundred years previously was the first to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
speak.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>
The Greeks knew not the Salmon: at any rate, no opsophagist
or other author notices the fish. Their silence is natural; the high
temperature of the water forbids its frequenting the Mediterranean or
its inflowing rivers.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>The length of the whole poem (483 lines) prevents entire quotation,
although the touch and movement all through display fully the instinct
and feeling for sport.</p>

<p>Pictures of the scenery along the banks of the Moselle are followed
by the enumeration and characterisation of the fish in its waters
rendered after the manner of the didactic epic. The poem furnishes a
lively description of the fishermen of the Moselle, made from actual
observation. Men in boats drag nets in midstream; men watch the corks
of little nets in shallower water; men perched on banks or on rocks
armed with rods scan the floats bobbing on the water, or jerk in the
prey. But we search for fly-fishing in vain.</p>

<p>“And now, where the bank gives easy access, a host of spoilers are
searching all the waters.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>
Alas! poor fish, ill sheltered by thine inmost stream! One of them
trails his wet lines far out in mid-river, and sweeps off the shoals
caught in his knotty seine; where the stream glides with placid
course, another spreads his drag-nets buoyed on their cork-floats.</p>

<p>“A third, leaning over the waters beneath the rock, lowers the arching
top of his supple rod, as he casts the hooks sheathed in deadly baits.
The unwary rovers of the deep rush on them with gaping mouth—too late,
their wide jaws feel through and through the stings of the hidden
barb—they writhe—the surface tells the tale, and the rod ducks to the
jerky twitch of the quivering horse-hair. Enough—with one whizzing
stroke the boy snatches his prey slant-wise from the water; the blow
vibrates on the breeze, as when a lash snaps in the air with a crack,
and the wind whistles to the shock.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>“The finny captives bound on the dry rocks, in terror at the sunlight’s
deadly rays; the force which stood to them in their native stream
languishes under our sky, and wastes their life in struggles to
respire.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
Now, only a dull throb shudders through the feeble frame, the
sluggish tail flaps in the last throes, the jaws gape, but the breath
which they inhale returns from the gills in the gaspings of death:
as, when a breeze fans the fires of the forge, the linen valve of
the bellows plays against its beechen sides, now opening, and now
shutting, to admit or to confine the wind.</p>

<p>“Some fish have I seen who, in the last agony, gathered their forces,
sprang aloft, and plunged head foremost into the river beneath,
regaining the waters for which they had ceased to hope. Impatient of
this loss, the thoughtless boy dashes in after them from above and
strikes out in wild pursuit. Even thus Glaucus of Anthedon, the old man
of the Bœotian Sea, when, after tasting Circe’s deadly herbs, he ate of
the grass which dying fish had nibbled,<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>
passes, a strange denizen, into the Carpathian deep. Armed with hook
and net, a fisherman in the depths of that realm whose upper waters
he had been wont to plunder, Glaucus glided along, the pirate of
those helpless tribes.”</p>

<p>Whether the <i>Salar</i> and the <i>Fario</i> of the Idyll are, or are not,
identical with the burn trout or salmon trout of modern days affords a
problem for ichthyologists, not for me.</p>

<p>Ausonius is the first to mention not only the <i>Salar</i> and <i>Fario</i><a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
but also our Pike—<i>Esox Lucius</i>.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>

<p>The striking silence as to a fish so far-spread in his habitat and so
notable in his habits as <i>Esox lucius</i> in all preceding Greek and Latin
literature must excuse a semi-excursus.</p>

<p>Cuvier writes: “We are necessarily astonished that the Ancients have
left us no document, so to speak, on a fish so abundant in Europe as
the Pike ... a fish which the Greeks must have known. The word <i>Esox</i>
occurs only once (Pliny, IX. 17) as an example of a large fish<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
comparable to the Tunny in form. In spite of Hardouin, I do not see
that <i>Esox</i> of the Rhine is the Pike, or believe with Ducange that it
is the Salmon. The name <i>Luccio</i> or <i>Luzzo</i>, by which we still call the
Pike in this country, gives force to the supposition that the Latins of
the time of Ausonius called it <i>Lucius</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>The astonishment at the absence of all reference to the Pike would be
greatly increased, if the authors, or really Valenciennes, had lived to
read later writers. Parkyn (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 131) cites the fish among
those represented by the craftsmen of both Palæolithic and Neolithic
Art in the caves of France and Spain. G. de Mortillet (<i>op. cit.</i>, p.
220) claims that the remains of Pike in the Palæolithic age occur not
infrequently. F. Keller (<i>op. cit.</i>, vol. I. 537, 544) notes their
presence in Neolithic finds at Moosseedorf, etc. Meek, <i>Migration
of Fish</i>, p. 18 (London, 1917), states that the Pike “occupied the
European region in Oligocene and Miocene times, and that the remains of
Pike are found in the Pleistocene of Breslau.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>Attempts have been made to explain the absence of this fish previous to
Ausonius by identifying <i>Esox lucius</i> with (A) the <i>Oxyrhynchus</i>, and
(B) the <i>Lupus</i>. These seem to me unsuccessful.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>Petrus Bellonius among the early writers upholds the first
identification. In his <i>Observations de Plusieurs Singularitëz</i>, Book
II. ch. 32 (published 1553), “Le fleuve du Nil nourrit plusieurs autres
poissons, lesquelz toutes fois ie ne veul specifier en ce lieu, sinon
entăt que le Brochet y est frequent, et que nous avons difficulté
de luy trouver une appellation antique, ie veul mŏstrer qu’il fut
ancieňement appellé Oxyrynchus.”</p>

<p>His effort breaks down for three reasons. First, Ælian says that the
<i>Oxyrhynchus</i>,—a fish supposed to have sprung from the blood of the
dead Osiris, or to be the <i>impiscation</i> (if the word may be coined) of
Osiris—although caught in the Nile (X. 46, 1, 12.), dwells mainly,
or according to Plutarch, <i>de Iside et Osiride</i>, 7, altogether in the
sea, whereas our <i>Esox</i> cannot endure sea-water. Second, the sharp
pointed form of beak (whence the name) cannot possibly represent
the broad goose-like mouthpiece of our Pike. Third, the size of the
<i>Oxyrhynchus</i>, often 8 cubits or 12 feet in length,<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>
proscribes the Pike.</p>

<p>Against the identification suggested by Franciscus Philadelphus
of <i>Esox lucius</i> with <i>Lupus</i> two reasons lean heavily: (A) the
etymological impossibility of λύκος (because of the wolflike nature of
the Pike<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>)
changing into Lucius, and (B) the <i>Lupus</i> is <i>always</i> in
Greek called λάβραξ, never λύκος.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
The story of how the <i>Lupus</i> comes to his death by the Prawn can be
read in Oppian<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> and in Ælian.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>
The fish, ever voracious, takes the prawns into his mouth by the
thousand; these, unable to resist or retreat, jump about and puncture
his throat and jaws so seriously that he soon dies of poison and
suffocation.</p>

<p>Pliny (IX. 17), it has been claimed, under the word <i>Esox</i> intends
our <i>Esox lucius</i>; but Cuvier maintains, and rightly, that his <i>Esox</i>
signifies some very large fish, perhaps a Tunny.</p>

<p>Sulpicius Severus, a presbyter who lived in Aquitania (<i>c.</i> 365-425
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) and penned an enthusiastic <i>Life of S. Martin of
Tour</i>,<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>
writes: “ad primum jactum reti permodico immanem Esocem extraxit.” It
is not for me to discuss or decry this amazing statement of a very
small net holding this monstrous <i>Esox</i>. But as the growth of a Pike
under the most favourable circumstances is probably not more than
2 lbs. a year for twelve years when usually it lessens materially,
I do suggest that the adjective <i>immanem</i> is hardly applicable
(unless St. Martin’s biographer, perhaps also a fisherman, has lapsed
unconsciously into a “fish story”) to a fish of about 20 or 30 lbs.,
and so would seem to confirm Cuvier.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>Pike, Carp, and Grayling were not apparently indigenous in England.
They were introduced from the Continent at some undetermined date by
one of the earlier religious orders for the better keeping of Fast
Days, which as enjoined by the Church, even in Queen Elizabeth’s time,
amounted to no less than 145 in number.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pike, though known in the thirteenth century, was very scarce. Its
price (as fixed by Edward I.) doubled that of the salmon, and exceeded
ten times over that of either the turbot or cod. Even as late as the
Reformation a large pike fetched as much as a February lamb, and a very
small pickerel more than a fat capon. This ratio of prices recalls the
rebuke administered by Cato the Censor to those prodigal Romans who
were willing to pay more for a dish of fish than for a whole ox.</p>

<p>In view of the necessity for fish on the fast days, which claimed
nearly half the year, the situation of twenty Sees (two Archbishoprics
and eighteen Bishoprics) out of twenty-seven on what were then salmon
rivers can hardly have been a geographical accident.</p>

<p>The Carp must also have been a scarce fish in Tudor England. Dame
Juliana Berners writes, “Ther be fewe in Englande.” Holinshed, <i>à
propos</i> of its scarcity in the Thames, states, “It is not long since
that kind of fish is brought over into England.” Leonard Mascall,
however, in his <i>Book of Fishinge</i> (1596), credits a Mr. Mascall of
Plumstead in Essex with the introduction of carp.</p>

<p>A hackneyed couplet, frequently quoted for the purpose of establishing
the date at which carp and pike were introduced, but so full of
mistakes as to be worthless, runs thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Turkies, Carps, Hops, Pickerell, and Beer,</span>
<span class="i4">Came into England all in one year.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Since another version brackets “Reformation, hops, bays, and beer,” the
year intended is obviously 1532.</p>

<p>A Pike, or rather the head of a fish so-called, served at supper is
said to have caused the end of Theodoric the Goth. In it he imagined
he saw the face and head of Symmachus, whom he had just put to death;
straightway he became so terror-stricken that within three days he had
joined his victim.</p>

</div>

<p>Leaving now the Lore of fishing among the Greeks and Romans, let us
turn, before examining the nature and number of their Lures, to their
estimation of Fish as a food.</p>

<p>We found, it will be remembered, that the Homeric poems make no mention
of fish being served at a banquet of the heroes, or even appearing on
the tables of people of position. Only poor or starving folk ate fish.
Although fish became later an insensate luxury, the Greeks at first
apparently abstained from all fish caught in fresh water, except the
eels of Lake Copaïs, then as now far-famed.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>This abstention from fresh-water fish originated (according to
Plutarch) in the belief that every spring and every stream was sacred
to some god or nymph, to catch whose property or progeny—the fish
in them—would be an act of impiety.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>
This sounds like a laboured explanation of a fact really due to
other causes. One of these is brought out clearly in Geikie. When
noticing the difference which existed between the Greek and the Roman
interest in and feeling for the sea, he, or rather Professor Mackail,
attributes it largely to a question of food supply.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Greece proper, from its comparative sterility and poverty of water,
was very limited in its capacity to grow crops or rear herds. It
compulsorily fell back largely on fish. And principally sea-fish,
because of their superior palatability, and because of the inadequacy,
owing to scarcity of lakes and perennial rivers, of fresh-water fish.</p>

<p>Whatever be the cause of the early abstention, three points arouse our
interest. (A) The passages in Greek writers (previous to Ælian) that
describe angling in <i>Greek fresh</i> waters, reach but a scant half-dozen,
while those that depict fishing in such waters—sacred lakes, temple
stew-ponds, and eeling in Lake Copaïs excepted—can probably be reckoned
on both hands.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>(B) The <i>Palatine Anthology</i> (at least in the period from 700
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> to 500 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>)
contains no reference (as far as I know) to aught but sea-fishing.</p>

<p>(C) The Greek comedians, Athenæus, the Greek opsophagic authors all
almost always reserve their appreciations for food from ἰχθυόεις πόντος.</p>

<p>The statement that the Romans abstained, like the Maeatæ or Celts<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>
of North Britain, from fresh-water fish from similar, or any motives,
cannot be established. It goes far beyond the evidence at our command,
although some aversion may be possibly deduced from Ovid (<i>Fast.</i>,
VI. 173 f.), and as regards shellfish from Varro. Unlike the Greeks,
however, they certainly in a very short period became great consumers
of fish from the Tiber, the Po, the Italian Lakes, and afterwards from
the Danube, Rhine, etc., but in their estimation, as in that of the
Greeks, fish from the sea ever held the higher place.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>If cost be a true criterion, this preference for salt-water fish
continued as late as the fourth century. In Diocletian’s Edict, 301
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, fixing the price of food, etc., throughout the Empire,
the maximum allowed for best quality sea-fish was nearly double that of
best quality river-fish.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

<p>In both Greece and Rome fish became luxuries of the most expensive
kind. Seas and rivers were scoured far and wide. No price was thought
too extravagant for a mullet, a sturgeon, or a turbot; three mullets of
historical celebrity even fetched in Rome the almost incredible sum of
£240!<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>In spite of many laws and decrees made at Athens and at Rome (where the
Censor often interfered<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>
in cases of extravagance in dress, living, etc.) the prices, owing to
the ingenuity of the sellers and the wild competition of the buyers,
rose constantly higher. The plaint of Cato the Censor that things
could not be well with a community, where “a fish fetched more than a
bull,” was uttered in and of a generation, which in comparison with
its successors looks frugal, even niggardly.</p>

<p>Pliny records (<i>N. H.</i>, IX. 31) “octo milibus nummum unum mullum
mercatum fuisse”—one mullet equalled £64, or the price of nine bulls!
He also says (<i>N. H.</i>, IX. 30) that mullets were plentiful and cheap
when under 2 lb., “a weight they rarely exceeded.” Martial (<i>Ep.</i>, XIV.
97) confirms this in his “Do not dishonour your gold serving-dish by a
small mullet: none less than two pounds is worthy of it.” In proportion
as they exceeded this, they grew in value.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>One would imagine that Nature had fallen in with the caprice of the
Romans, for the fish seems to have grown larger in the decline of the
Empire, as if to humour the extravagance of this degenerate people.
Horace thought he had pretty well stigmatised the frantic folly of his
glutton by a mullet of 3 lbs. (<i>Sat.</i>, II. 2, 33); but the next reign
furnished one of 4½ lbs., which presented to and sold at auction by the
Emperor Tiberius was bought by Octavius for £40 (Seneca, <i>Ep.</i>, XCV.
42), while in Juvenal, IV. 15 f., we have one of 6 lbs.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>How long the passion for these big mullets lasted it is impossible to
tell, but Macrobius, speaking with indignation of one purchased by
Asinius Celer in the reign of Claudius for £56 (in Pliny, <i>N. H.</i>,
IX. 31, I find the price was £64!), declares that in his time (fifth
century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) such mad prices had vanished.</p>

<p>Alongside of Pliny’s caustic comment<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>
that the price of a victorious Triumph equalled that of a cook, or a
fish, can be set the lament of the Greek comedians that for some fish
one had to pay ἴσον ἲσῳ, <i>i.e.</i> for weight avoirdupois you handed
over a similar weight in money or, as Mayor neatly renders it, “£
for lb.” This gibe at the public mania sprang from bitter personal
experience. At Rome, too, we read “of those who sell rare fish for
their weight in money.”</p>

for £10 to procure a dinner, which was not really a good one because
nearly all the money was spent on a <i>mullet</i>—</p>

<p>The folly of the Roman nobles and millionaires did not exhaust itself
in buying fish at insane prices, or squandering their fortunes on
<i>Vivaria</i> and similar extravagances. They touched a yet lower depth of
infamy by taking their <i>cognomen</i> from fish.</p>

<p>Thus Columella contrasts the custom of their ancestors of taking a
<i>cognomen</i> from some great victory, <i>e.g.</i> Numantinus or Isauricus,
with that of their decadent successors such as Licinius <i>Muræna</i> or
Sergius <i>Orata</i>.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

<p>The Greek Comic Poets and Satirists castigate with bitter sarcasms and
jeers the frenzied, almost cat-like devotion to fish.</p>

<p>Even Diogenes the Cynic came to an untimely end by eating with eager
haste a polypus <i>raw</i>.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>
Philoxenus the Poet, when warned by his doctor, after “he had bought
a polypus two cubits long, dressed it, and ate it up himself all but
the head,” that he had but six hours left to live and to arrange his
affairs, bequeathed his poems and the prizes of his poems to the Nine Muses:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
The moralists of the Empire bewail “the costly follies of the
patricians.” Juvenal, Martial, and other Roman Satirists lampoon the
gluttony and extravagance connected with opsophagy, or the eating of
<i>fish</i>. This limitation of the word is explained by Plutarch (<i>Symp.</i>,
IV. 4), “fish alone above all the rest of the dainties is called ὄψον,
because it is more excellent than all the rest,” and characteristically
defended by Athen., VII. 4.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>The banquets of the Greeks<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
seem to have outdone even those of Imperial Rome. Both must have
weighed heavy, alike on table and on chest.</p>

<p>At these, writes Badham, “although all flesh was there, although
quadrupeds mustered strong, and a whole heaven of poultry, still it
was the flesh of <i>fishes</i> that ever bore away the palm; they were the
soul of the supper, and the number of kinds brought together at one
repast was surprisingly great. From the poetic bills of fare preserved
by Athenæus I have verified twenty-six species of fish in one Attic
supper, and not less than forty at another!<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
On the fish course being brought in, the appearance of the banqueting
hall soon became more splendid: hardware made way for solid silver:
gold breadbaskets were now handed round: the flower of youth of both
sexes entered bearing bits of pumice, drugs against drunkenness, and
trays full of chaplets of Violets and Amaranth, while others hung up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
that mystic flower, the present of the God of Love to the God of
Silence, to intimate that henceforth all things said or done at the
feast were to be kept, inviolable and <i>sub rosa</i>, under which flower
by the rain of myriads of petals all the guests literally soon
were.”<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<p>The amount of money spent on suppers and entertainments at Rome
staggers conception. The figures recorded by even serious historians
seem beyond all belief: for instance, the ordinary expense of Lucullus
for a supper in the Hall of Apollo is given at 50,000 <i>drachmæ</i>, or £1600.</p>

<p>At one of the suppers to which it was the custom of Nero to invite
himself—his meals, Suetonius (<i>Nero</i>, 27) tells us, were prolonged
from mid-day to midnight or <i>vice-versa</i>—no less than £32,000 was
expended on chaplets, and at another still more on roses alone. But
it must be remembered that the Italian rose bloomed only for one
day—witness the lines, “Una dies aperit, conficit una dies,” and
“Quam longa una dies, ætas tam longa rosarum.”<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>
The cost of an entertainment by his brother in honour of the Emperor
Vitellius on his entrance to Rome was nearly £80,000!</p>

<p>But of Vitellius himself let Suetonius<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>
speak: “He was chiefly addicted to the vices of luxury and cruelty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
He always made three meals a day, sometimes four—breakfast, dinner,
supper, and a drunken revel afterwards. This load of food he bore
well enough, from a custom to which he had inured himself, of
frequently vomiting!” No wonder Seneca lashes the gluttons of Rome
with “Vomunt ut edant, edunt ut vomant!”<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>
For each of these meals he would make different appointments at the
houses of his friends for the same day. None ever entertained him at
less expense than 400,000 sesterces (or £3200). But the most famous
entertainment—given in his honour by his brother—commandeered no less
than 2,000 choice fishes, and 7,000 birds.</p>

<p>Yet even this supper he himself outdid at a feast to celebrate
the first use of a dish fashioned expressly for him, and from its
extraordinary size yclept “The Shield of Minerva.” In this dish<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>
costing £100,000 and capable of feeding one hundred and thirty guests
“were tossed together the livers of charfish, the brains of pheasants
and peacocks, the tongues of flamingos, and the entrails (or rather the
milt) of lampreys, brought in ships of war from the Carpathian Sea, or
the Spanish Straits.”<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

<p>In order “satiare inexplebiles libidines,” etc., Vitellius is believed
to have squandered in a few months<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>
no less than seven million two hundred and sixty-five thousand pounds
(£7,265,000)!<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<p>No wonder that Caligula, perhaps the biggest spendthrift of the Cæsars,
laid down the maxim that “a man ought to be either an economist, or an Emperor!”</p>

<p>The fabulous sums spent on entertainments by the Greeks and Romans were
equalled, even surpassed by the Persians, the Sybarites, the Egyptians,
and other nations. But the cost, though prodigious, of Cleopatra’s
four-day entertainment to Antony and his captains (in the <i>menu</i> of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
which fishes from the Nile and the Red Sea figured conspicuously), pales
before that of a supper given in honour of Xerxes and his captains by
Antipater of Thasos, <i>i.e.</i> 400 (presumably Attic) talents or some
£100,000! No wonder Herodotus mournfully adds, “Wherever Xerxes took
two meals, dinner and supper, that city was utterly ruined!”<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>Nor at the feasts, which the invader of Media made “for a great
multitude <i>every day</i>,” was it a case of taking up of the fragments
that remained but twelve basketsful, because, as Posidonius (in the
14th book of his <i>History</i>) continues, “besides the food that was
consumed and the heaps of fragments which were left, every guest
carried away with him entire joints of beasts, and birds, and fishes,
which had never been carved, all ready dressed,<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>
in sufficient quantities to fill a waggon. And after this they were
presented with a quantity of sweetmeats,” etc.</p>

<p>The prize, however, for mad lavishness must be adjudged even in
a race of such strenuous competitors, to “that most admirable of
all monarchs,” Ptolemy Philadelphus. It is “Eclipse first, the
rest nowhere,” if the description of the coronation feast given by
Callixenus in his <i>History of Alexandria</i> be faithfully rendered by
Athenæus.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>The imagination of the average reader before reaching the last chapters
will have been fatigued and appalled by the picture of overwhelming
wealth and magnificence, but as Ptolemy, after a reign of grandiose and
continuous expenditure, left at his death £200,000,000 in the treasury,
the cost of the whole entertainment must have been as nought compared
with his revenue.</p>

<p>M. Gavius Apicius, after squandering half a million sterling on the
indulging his passion for creating new dishes and new combinations of
food from materials collected in Europe, Asia, and Africa, one day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
balanced his accounts. Finding that but barely £80,000 remained,
and despairing of being able to satisfy the cravings of his hunger
from such a miserable pittance he poisoned himself. He is possibly
the author of a Treatise (in ten books!) of recipes for new dishes
and new sauces for fish; for one of the latter more than twenty-five
ingredients were necessary.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

<p>The importance attached to cooks and cooking finds a cloud of
witnesses in Greek and Roman writers. Athenæus in especial recites
their triumphs and their bombastic boasts. So high was the <i>chef’s</i>
position and so excellent was the <i>cuisine</i> in Greece that we find the
Roman ambassadors, who in the sixth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> were
sent to investigate the working of Solon’s Laws, bringing home a special report
on Cooking!</p>

<p>To these Attic <i>cordons bleus</i> in succeeding generations not only
Italy but Persia were glad to send pupils, and pay exorbitant fees for
tuition. The Attic cook gave himself the same airs of superiority over
his Roman brother, as the French <i>chef</i> over the Anglican—him “of a
hundred sects but only one sauce.” Carême, the <i>chef</i> of Talleyrand
(the author of this <i>mot</i>), never abated his claim that to the success
of the Congress of Vienna he contributed no less than his master.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>
His salary, however, does not begin to compare with that of Antony’s
cook, £3000 a year and “perquisites” galore.

<p>Anaxandrides<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>
compares the beauteous work of portrait painters unfavourably with the beauty
of a dish of fish. Xenarchus<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
contrasts poets with fishmongers, much to the detriment of the former:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Poets are nonsense: for they never say</span>
<span class="i4">A single thing that’s new. But all they do</span>
<span class="i4">Is to clothe old ideas in language new,</span>
<span class="i4">Turning the same things o’er again</span>
<span class="i4">And upside down. But as for fishmongers,</span>
<span class="i4">They’re an inventive race and yield to none,” etc.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Hegesippus’s summing up, “But the whole race of cooks is conceited and
arrogant,” finds confirmation in dozens of instances. Two grandiloquent
boasts may serve: “I have known many a guest who has, for my sake,
eaten up his whole estate,” and</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“I am in truth a God, I bring the dead</span>
<span class="i4">By mere scent of my food, to life again.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Self-laudation is no monopoly of Greece, or Sicily, whence came perhaps
the most famous of the tribe. In our own Beaumont and Fletcher’s
play—<i>The Bloody Brother</i>—a <i>chef</i> vaunts,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“For fish I’ll make you a standing lake of white broth,</span>

<p>Lucian, in his witty Dialogue,<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>
makes Hermes act as auctioneer at the sale of the different creeds as
personified by their founders or by philosophers, and dilate on the
exceptional merits of the lot then under the hammer, “because he will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
teach you how long a gnat will live, and what sort of soul an oyster
possesses.” Mr. Lambert states that Ausonius wrote a poem on the
oyster! To be more accurate, he wrote two,<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>
and lengthy ones to boot!</p>

<p>The Emperor Domitian (Juvenal, IV.) ordered a special sitting of
the Senate to deliberate and advise on a matter of such grave State
importance as the best method of cooking a turbot.</p>

<p>Greek and Roman writers frequently poke fun at the <i>gourmets</i> who
asserted that they could instantly tell from the flavour whence the
fish came: from what sea, and what part of that sea, from what river,
and even from which side of that river.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>Either these ancient connoisseurs were blessed with a more exquisite
and developed sense of taste than we moderns, or the whole pose was
an intolerable affectation, for “they drenched their subtly-conceived
dishes with garum, alec, and other sauces, which were so strong and
composite that it would have been hardly possible to distinguish a
fresh fish from a putrid cat—except by the bones!”<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<p>This assertion is none too strong, if the receipts for these sauces be
duly pondered. Mention of <i>garum</i>, which gets its name from being made
originally from the salted blood and entrails of a fish called <i>garon</i>
or <i>garos</i> by the Greeks, is in classical writers very general: we find
it even in Æschylus and Sophocles.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>The various sauces known in Latin are too numerous to recite.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
The two best, although the authorities are far from unanimous, seem to have
been made out of the gills and entrails of the Mackerel and Tunny. The
components of one recipe justify Robinson. In addition to other odds
and ends, its outstanding feature was the gore and entrails of the
Tunny, crammed in a vessel hermetically closed, and only drawn off when
decomposition was complete! No wonder Plato the Comedian complains ...
“drenching them in putrid <i>garum</i> they will suffocate me.”</p>

<p><i>Alec</i>, like <i>garum</i>, once the name of a fish (possibly the anchovy),
came to signify only the sauce made from it, and subsequently from
other cheap fish. It differed from <i>garum</i> chiefly from being thicker,
and judging from the recipes probably nastier. You took first the dregs
and fæculence remaining after the <i>garum</i> liquor had been decanted:
to them, add turbid brine, sodden bodies of the fish, etc., and then
you have the semi-solid compound, from which <i>alec</i> was derived, not
inaptly yclept “Putrilago.”<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>If, as Badham (p. 69) asserts but not convincingly, <i>garum</i> a double
duty served, as a sauce and as a liqueur, the price of the latter was
exorbitant, over £3 a gallon.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>
Martial (<i>Ep.</i>, XIII. 102) in</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Expirantis adhuc scombri de sanguine primo</span>
<span class="i2">Accipe fastosum, munera <i>cara</i>, garum,”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">calls attention to the expensive nature of his present, for <i>garum</i>
made from the <i>scomber</i> was in Pliny’s words “laudatissimum,” while the
ἄλμη, or <i>muria</i>, fabricated from the intestines and nothing else of
the tunny was cheap and inferior.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>Apart from their gastronomic popularity, the medical efficacy of the
various <i>gara</i> as pæaned by Pliny must, like the Waverley Pen, have
“come as a boon and a blessing to men,” in the wide range of their
cures.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>
For ulcers of the mouth and ears, one <i>mirifice prodest</i>. On the
application of other <i>gara</i>, “dumb-foundered flee away” burns, blains,
dysenteries, bites of dogs, <i>maximeque crocodili</i>, etc. Chapter 44
might indeed easily pass as the leaflet of an advance agent for a
patent pill.</p>

<p>With the knowledge and use of the various internal parts of fish, it is
strange to find Caviare, made out of the roe of the Sturgeon, first in
a recipe of the ninth century. Soft and hard roes then, as now, were
generally exported, but as a separate article it became known only in
Byzantine times.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>With the hungry desire for fish among all classes and with the deep
pockets of the rich enabling them to go to any extreme price, is it
any wonder that the trade of a fishmonger at Athens and Rome was
most lucrative? Several fishmongers acquired large fortunes and high
position. The Athenians even raised to the rank of citizens the sons
of Chærephilus, for the adequate reason that he sold such excellent
pickled fish!<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>At Athens, and probably at Rome, there existed a Society or Corporation
of Fishmongers, akin to our own Fishmongers’ Company, one of the many
trade guilds of mediæval times. Its power and political pull often
defeated or evaded the stringent regulations, which from time to time
fixed the price of fish. In early times fish were sold by the fishermen
themselves, as soon as the Fish-Market at Rome had been opened by the
ringing of its bell.</p>

of animals) certainly and widely prevailed. Proof can be piled on
proof—<i>pace</i> a passage from Plutarch and <i>pace</i> the contention that
the practice is not purely Hellenic—from the pages of both Greek and
Roman authors.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the statement of Agatharchides of Knidos: that the
largest eels from Lake Copaïs were sacrificed by the Bœotians, who
crowned them like human victims, and after sprinkling them with meal
offered prayers over them.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
Or the story in Posidonius the Stoic of Sarpedon celebrating his
victory by “sacrificing to Neptune, who puts armies to flight, enormous
quantities of fish.”<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>
Theocritus in his fragmentary <i>Berenice</i>, Ælian,<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>
and Antigonus on the offering of the Tunny all confirm the
custom.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>Plutarch (<i>Symp.</i>, VIII. 3) would seem indeed the only exception: he
straightly asserts, according to Nonnius and others, that “no fish is
fitting for offering or sacrifice.”<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

<p>This is but another instance of Plutarch’s being saddled with
responsibility for some expression or opinion uttered by one of his
characters, as is clearly shown by the words: “Sylla, commending the
discourse, added with regard to the Pythagoreans that they tasted
especially the flesh sacrificed to the gods, but that no fish is fit
for offering or sacrifices.”</p>

<p>P. Stengel holds that fish, with the curious exception of the Eel,
were not sacrificed to the gods in early days, because they neither
possessed blood which could be poured forth at the altar, nor could
they be offered up alive as could be an enemy, a sacrifice which found
special favour in divine eyes.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>This statement, unless explained in some manner, contrasts queerly
with the passage in Plutarch’s <i>Life of Numa Pompilius</i>, where the
king is taught by Picus and Faunus, reinforced subsequently by
Jupiter himself, to make a lustration “as a charm against thunder and
lightning, composed of Onions, Hair, and Pilchards!” Lest these curious
constituents arouse your mirth and infect you with doubt as to their
efficacy, hearken unto Plutarch’s further words, “which is used even
unto this day!”</p>

<p>From this account (wittily versed by Ovid)<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>
we discover Jupiter, resentful at being brought down to earth by the
magic of Picus and Faunus, ordering the charm to consist “of Heads”—“Of
onions,” replied Numa. “Human”—“Hairs,” said Numa, desirous to fence
against the dreadful injunction, and interrupting the god. “Living,”
said Jupiter—“Pilchards,” broke in Numa.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether fish were but rarely sacrificed or not, Festus<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>
at any rate makes clear that at the <i>Ludi</i> on June 7th, and possibly
the <i>Volcanalia</i> in September (although at the latter the oblations
were mostly animal), Roman fishermen did offer up fish, “quod id genus
pisciculorum vivorum datur ei Deo pro animis humanis.”</p>

<p>Offerings of fish may be (as O. Keller suggests) a relic of Totemism
resting on the belief that the spirits of men after death pass into fish.</p>

<p>The suggestion gains force when we remember that Anaximander<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>
and others taught that men lived once as fishes, but later came on land
and threw off their scales; and that the early religious conceptions
of Latium were so debased as readily to engender or harbour such a
conception. On the other hand, it must be admitted that not a single
clear and convincing case of Totemism has hitherto been adduced from
the Græco-Italic area.</p>

<p>In these oblations and in Varro’s “Populus <i>pro se</i> in ignem animalia
mittit,”<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>
an animal in place of a man be it remarked—can be detected a mitigated
survival of the widespread custom of human sacrifice in propitiation of
a deity.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>
On much the same lines grew up the custom, as civilisation progressed,
of burning the weapons of, instead of killing, the captured foe, after
a battle. The immolation of prisoners formed a sacrifice not so much
of revenge, as one in honour of the slain on the side of the victors:
such at least is the conclusion suggested to me by the words of Festus,
“humanum sacrificium dicebant, quod mortui causa fiebat.”<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>As offerings at Rome had dwindled from men down to animals, or small
fish, or eventually even salt or pickled fish, or fish mixed with
wheat, so among the Israelites the Scape-Goat had become the vicarious
victim offered up to Jehovah “for the sins of all the people,” and
among the Assyrians the oblation had even shrunk to little fishes, made
of ivory or metal.</p>

<p>Fish, in addition to being worshipped as gods or held so sacred that
eating them was prohibited, were frequently used by the Priests or by
the Augurs for divinatory purposes. In accordance with their swimming
or not, and in what direction, with their leaps into the air, how,
whence, and whither effected, with their reception, or refusal, or
smashing with their tails of particular foods, were framed the oracular
deliverances or priestly predictions, as Plutarch and others show.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

<p>Thus at the spring of Limyra in Lycia, if the fish seized food thrown
to them greedily, the omen was favourable; if they flapped at it with
their tails, the reverse.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> In Lydia (according to Varro<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>)
from their movements, when rising to the surface at the sound of a
flute, the watching seer deduced and delivered his answer. Divination
was not limited to certain holy waters; when in the war between
Augustus and Sextus Pompeius a fish darted from the sea and threw
itself at the feet of the former, the ready augur found no difficulty
in acclaiming him as the future “Ruler of the Waves.”<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></p>

<p>Ichthyic soothsaying held its ground among the Greeks of the Byzantine
empire. One prediction<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>
—when a boiled fish shall spring out of the pot, then the last hour
of Constantinople will have struck—is of present-day importance. But
whether the fish has filled his saltatory <i>rôle</i>, and if so whether
the doom of the city <i>has</i> sounded, lie for decision at the moment of
writing on the lap of the Big Four in Paris.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>The belief that fish could and did foretell events lingered long in
England; thus the deaths of Henry II. and of Cromwell were foreshadowed
by the fighting of fish among themselves in the <i>vivaria</i> belonging to
Henry II. and Cromwell.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>As is but natural in hot countries, the trade in salted and pickled
fish, the τάριχος of the Greeks, the <i>salsamentum</i> of the Romans, grew
to great importance.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>This sweet-sour comestible was among both nations early, universal, and
pushed to the extreme of madness.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>
In such high esteem was it held that it came to be looked on as an
offering meet for the gods. Cato and others testify to the exorbitant
prices commanded by Pontic and kindred <i>salsamentum</i>, of which a small
flask fetched more than one hundred sheep! Of every kind—and they were
as diverse as the countries and towns that furnished them—we find
champions ready to go to the stake to prove the superiority of their
own pet choice.</p>

<p>Of some towns it was the chief, if not the only, commerce. As modern
towns frequently bear for their arms or on their seal some device
connected with their history or trade, so ancient seaports which produced
<i>salsamentum</i> often stamped their coins with the figures of fish, etc.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus Olbia, one of the most important markets for salt or pickled
fish, bears on its money an eagle taking a fish,<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>
while a copper coin of Carteia<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>
depicts an angler, possibly Mercury—a god of fishing. Sinope, and
many other places, have left similar numismatic representations. Of
most interest from a monetary point of view are the Greek diobols of
Tarentum. Those bearing the figure of Taras on his dolphin passed as
current token in the fish market.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>Famous for the beauty of their execution were some of the Syracusan
coins, representing the head of Arethusa surrounded by dolphins. The
accounts of the legend vary. Shortly, the lovely maid of the train of
Artemis fled the embraces of her lover Alpheus,</p>

and prevailed on Oceanus to open a way through his waves till reaching
seeming safety in the Isle of Ortygia, close to Syracuse, she welled
forth in the midst of the salt sea a fountain of sweet pure water.
Alpheus, not to be outdone, got himself transformed into a river to
emerge also at Ortygia and to mix his stream with the spring of the nymph.</p>

<p>Around her head or amidst her hair on Syracusan coins dart dolphins
(some hold eels, which were sacred to Artemis), symbolic of the sea,
to show that the sweetness of the fountain was still untainted by the
surrounding salt of the ocean.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>
Sweet the water may have been, but Athenæus (II. 16) characterises it
as “of invincible hardness.” These coins are the work of those great

The octopus, judging by the fact that at Mycenæ in one tomb alone
Dr. Schliemann excavated fifty-three golden models of it, and by
the many gold ornaments of which the fish forms the chief or only
figure, was undoubtedly a very frequent and favourite subject for the
craftsmen of the ‘Minoan’ age, although it did not bulk so big in early
Mediterranean religion as L. Siret would make out.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p>The taxes or duties derived from fish or fishing furnished the
<i>peculiar</i> of the Temples at Delos, Ephesus, and elsewhere: at
Byzantium and some other places they went to the city. After the Roman
conquests these imposts were paid not to the cities (Cyzicus and other
places were the exceptions), but to the State, and were gathered by the
intermediary “publicans.”<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>With stories before him, such as those of the suppers recorded by the
dozen in Athenæus, and given to and by the Emperor Vitellius, for which
the fish were brought in ships of war from the Carpathian Sea and
the Straits of Spain, it is no wonder that a modern author is driven
to conclude that the ancients thought more of the edible than the
sporting qualities of the fish. They ransacked the habitable globe for
side-dishes, but did not trouble themselves about the precepts of Mrs. Glasse.</p>

<p>Apart from this ransacking of the globe, the Romans developed, as the
demand for fish by rich and poor alike grew ever greater, the Egyptian
and Assyrian <i>vivarium</i> to a marvellous extent.</p>

<p>Built at first (as Columella avers<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>)
simply for the purpose of supplying fresh fish for the table, they
found such favour that no self-respecting Roman could afford to be
without his <i>vivarium</i>. With the rich they were the occasion of most
costly ostentation and extravagant expenditure.</p>

<p>Whether Sergius Aurata (or Orata) took or not his cognomen<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>
from the fish <i>Aurata</i>, all writers identify him as the first to build
a <i>vivarium</i> for oysters. From their sale, from the income derived
from the vapour baths (<i>pensiles balineas</i>), of which he was also the
pioneer, and from the villas erected on his property, close to Baiæ,
the baths, and the oysters, he amassed an enormous fortune. He posed
as the Pontiff of the Palate; his was the final decision, from which
lay no appeal, as to which sea or which part of what river produced the
best of the various fishes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>From the not unnatural bias of owner and founder he adjudged the
Lucrine oysters finest of all. Pliny’s words (IX. 79) that, when Orata
“ennobled” the Lucrine, British oysters had not yet reached Rome convey
a gratifying compliment to our insular pride, somewhat dashed by Pliny
plumping for the Circeian.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

The Brundisian oyster when planted in Lake Lucrinus not only kept its own
flavour, but took on that of its new home.</p>

When “Trajan was in Parthia at a distance of many days’ journey
from the sea, he sent him oysters, which he kept fresh by a clever
contrivance of his own invention; real oysters not like the sham
anchovies which the cook of Nicomedes, king of the Bithynians, made for
him,” when far inland and yearning for oysters.</p>

<p>To Fulvius Herpinus or Lippinus belongs the credit of being the
first—just before the Civil War—to fatten the <i>Cochlea</i>, or
sea-snail, in a <i>vivarium</i>. By careful collecting from Africa and
Illyrica and skilful feeding, his cockles became renowned for size and
number.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>In the period between the taking of Carthage and the reign of
Vespasian, the taste in fish became a perfect passion; for its
gratification Proconsuls enriched, like our Clives from India, beyond
the dreams of avarice by the spoils of Asia and Africa, incurred the
most lavish expense. Thus Licinius Muræna, Quintus Hortensius, Lucius
Philippus constructed immense basins,<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>
which they filled with rare species. Lucullus, like the Persian king at
Athos, but with unlike motive, caused even a mountain to be pierced to
introduce sea-water into his fish-ponds, and for the achievement was
dubbed by Pompey, “Togatus Xerxes.”<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>But in many cases the huge outlay was repaid with interest. Varro<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>
avers that Hirrius (who first before all others designed and carried
out the <i>vivarium</i> for <i>Murænæ</i>) received twelve million sesterces
in rent from his properties, and employed the entire sum in the care
of his fishes! At the death of Lucullus the fish in his stew-ponds
realised over £32,000.</p>

<p>The rich Patricians were not satisfied with a single pond; their fish
preserves were divided into compartments where they kept different
kinds. In case any reader, like the Third Fisherman in Shakespeare’s
<i>Pericles</i>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Marvel how the fishes live in the sea,”</span>
</div></div></div>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and to add that the fish confined in these
separate ponds found in the waters their business and livelihood from
the <i>testaceæ</i> purposely planted.</p>

<p>This passion for <i>piscinæ</i> gradually impoverished the Mediterranean and
other seas. Fish in the Tyrrhenian Sea had no time to come to maturity,
because as Columella complains, “Maria ipsa Neptunumque clauserunt!”<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>
While Varro and Columella give careful directions as to the making and
keeping of practical fish stews, they keep silence as to methods of
capturing the inhabitants.</p>

<p>I have come across no notice of <i>vivaria</i> among the Greeks:<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>
their kinsman in Sicily erected at least one magnificent example.
Diodorus Siculus (XI. 2) tells us that the Agrigentines (probably by
the labour of the Carthaginian prisoners) “sunk a fishpond, with great
costs and expenses, seven furlongs in compass, and twenty cubits in
depth: in this water, brought both from fountains and rivers, fish were
planted which soon supplied them with an ample stock both for food and pleasure.”</p>

<p>To the great Archimedes is due the unique achievement of a <i>vivarium</i>
on board ship. It is impossible here to set forth all the glories of
this wonderful vessel, intended for the corn traffic between Egypt and
Sicily, and propelled by means of huge sweeps—every sweep worked by a
team of twenty men (εἰκοσόρος).

<p>Her Gymnasium, her three Baths, her Flower Garden, her trellised
Vineyard, her Temple to Venus, her Library with its floor of mosaics
exhibiting a series of subjects taken from the <i>Iliad</i>, and, lastly,
in the bow by the side of the huge reservoir of 21,000 gallons, her
water-tight well, made of planks lined with lead, and filled with
<i>sea</i>-water, in which a great number of fish were always kept—if all
these wonders of a ship, launched over 2200 years ago, do not cause
us to think a little, and to abate our boasts over our <i>Imperators</i>
and <i>Olympics</i>, then to the cocksure conceit of the twentieth century
naught is of avail, not even the account given by Moschion.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<p>Disregarding the practical directions of Varro (whom Schneider<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>
stamps, with regard to fish, etc., as a mere plagiarist of Greek
authors), of Columella, and in a lesser degree of Pliny how to
construct and conduct paying stew-ponds, and turning a deaf ear to
Varro’s warning that “to build, stock, and keep them up was most
costly,” the Romans thought no money, no time, too much to expend on
<i>vivaria</i>.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>
Possession and cultivation of fish in <i>vivaria</i>, which were sometimes
made in the dining-room, became the one delight of these “Tritones
Piscinarum,” as Cicero dubs two of his friends.</p>

<p>The primary cause for their existence, a ready supply of fresh fish in
a hot climate, was forgotten. Other owners resembled Hortensius, who
(according to Varro) “not only was never entertained by his fish at
table, but was scarcely ever easy, unless engaged in entertaining or
fattening <i>them</i>.” The death of “his friend,” the <i>Muræna</i>, between
whom and himself such a close attachment existed, almost broke his
heart.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>Macrobius testifies that Crassus, “first among all the greatest men of
Rome, mourned a <i>muræna</i>” (probably it of the earrings and necklace of
precious stones) “found dead in his <i>vivarium</i> even as a daughter.” It
was on the occasion of Domitius twitting him with “Did you not weep
when your fish died?” that Crassus got back with “Did you not bury
three wives and never weep at all?”<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p>Of Hortensius Varro continues:<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>
“His mullet give him infinitely more concern than my mules and asses
do; for while I, with one lad, support all my thrifty stud on a little
barley, etc., the fish-servants of Hortensius are not to be counted. He
has fishermen in fine weather toiling to procure them food; when the
weather is too boisterous for fishing, then a whole troop of butchers
and dealers in provisions send in their estimates for keeping his
<i>alumni</i> fat. Hortensius so looks after his mullet as to forget his
men; a sick slave has less chance of getting a draught of cold water in
a fever than these favoured fish of being kept cool in their stews in Midsummer.”</p>

<p>The fish often answered to their names when called by their master, or
their keeper. The latter, <i>nomenclator</i>, made a very handsome income
from the admiring crowds, who flocked to see the fish perform their
exercises with wagging tails or heads bedecked with rich jewels.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>Antonia, to whom the lands and villa of Hortensius descended, even
stripped herself of her earrings to put them on a <i>muræna</i>. This lady,
apart from this anecdote, was no ordinary person. We find her passing
from the positive of celebrated renown for her beauty, her virtue, her
chastity (no mean feat in that day!), through the comparative of being
the mother of Germanicus Cæsar and Claudius, and the grandmother of
Caligula (which last, in slang parlance, “wanted a bit of doing!”),
unto the superlative of deathless fame in Pliny’s “Nunquam exspuisse”
(never spat!).<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>The savage use to which Vedius Pollio put his <i>vivaria</i> can be learnt
from the pages of Pliny<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>
and Seneca.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>
A slave, for breaking a crystal decanter at a banquet given to
Augustus, was ordered to be thrown instantly into a <i>piscina</i>, there to
be eaten alive by the nibbling voracious <i>Murænæ</i>. Escaping from his
guards he threw himself at the Emperor’s feet, “beseeching nothing else
except that he should die otherwise than as food for fish”<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>.
Cæsar moved “novitate crudelitatis” (he little knew that this was his
host’s cheery custom) commanded the crystals of Pollio to be smashed
on the spot, the slave to be freed, and all the fishponds to be filled up.</p>

<p>As conducive to <i>la joie de vivre</i> of the other slaves, the command was
commendable, for the bite of the <i>Muræna’s</i> serrated teeth, according
to Nicander’s <i>Theriaca</i>—that “nullius fidei farrago”—owing to its
mating with the viper, dealt poisonous death and destruction to the
fishermen driven by its pursuit “headlong from their boats,” and was
only curable by a mixture made of ashes from its own burnt head! So
dreaded was this fish—curious is it not, to read, although from its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
savage nature no other could inhabit the same <i>vivarium</i>, the many
stories of its tameness and docility?—that one of the direst of
imprecations ran that in the under-world your enemy’s lungs should be
mangled by <i>Murænæ</i>!<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p>In times preceding these infatuated extravagant ages, the purpose
for which <i>vivaria</i> were first created was steadfastly kept in mind
and wonderfully advanced by practical pisciculturists. From being a
mere pond for keeping fish alive till needed for the table, <i>vivaria</i>
developed in the course of time into spawning grounds.</p>

<p>The pisciculturists went even farther. They turned lakes and rivers
into natural <i>vivaria</i> by depositing in them not only adult fish,
but the spawn of all such species as are in the habit, although born
at sea, of pushing some distance up estuaries and streams. Columella
instances specially the rivers Velinus, Sabatinus, Ciminus, and
Volsinius as examples of the great success of this experiment in fish
propagation.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>Comacchio on the Adriatic, from its extraordinary advantages of
position and of fish-food, can hardly have escaped being utilised for
similar purposes by the Romans. For many centuries, at any rate, its
<i>valli</i> or breeding grounds have been renowned. Ariosto sings its
speciality:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“La Città che in mezzo alle piscose</span>
<span class="i4">Paludi del Pô, téme ambe le foci.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Tasso hands it down as the place where the fish—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">“finds itself within a prison swamp</span>
<span class="i0">Nor can escape, for that seraglio</span>
<span class="i0">Is aye to entrance wide, to exit barred.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>At the present day over twelve hundred tons of fish, eight hundred of
them eels, are annually captured at Comacchio.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since the above was printed, new and interesting evidence of the
importance of fish, not only as an economic, but also as a hygienic,
factor in the nation’s prosperity has been furnished by Prof. J. A.
Thomson in his lecture before the Royal Institution, January 6, 1921.</p>

<p>He traced a connection between the decline of Greece and a shortage
of little fishes. There was strong reason to believe that one of the
causes for the decay of “the glory that was Greece” was that malaria was
brought into the State.</p>

<p>The little creature, which caused malaria, lived on the mosquito by
whom it was carried. The mosquito spent its larval life in the fresh
waters. Little fish were the enemy of the mosquito—particularly the
fish known as “millions”—which consumed the pest at a great rate.</p>

<p>The professor suggested, therefore, that what had happened in Greece
was that there had not been enough little fish to keep the mosquitos
in check. Because of this, malaria had been brought into the country,
and that plague helped, if it did not cause, the destruction of the
wonderful civilisation of Greece.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class="h_subtitle">LEGAL REGULATIONS OF ROME AS REGARDS FISHING</span></h3></div>

<p>Previous instances of taking fish belonging to another have so far only
been attended by divine or superhuman punishment. I venture now a few
sentences on what were the Roman (I have discovered no Greek) legal
regulations—for there does not appear to have existed at Rome any
special <i>law</i> on Fishing—and how the rights of fisheries and fishers
were protected.</p>

<p>From the evidence available it is clear—</p>

<div class="blockquot1">
<p>(1) That among <i>Res Nullius</i>, or things belonging to no one, were fish
and wild animals in a state of nature. The <i>Digest</i>, 41. 1. 1, lays
down that “omnia animalia, quæ terra, mari, cælo capiuntur, id est feræ
bestiæ, volucres, et pisces, capientum fiunt.”</p>

<p>(2) That they became the property of the person who first “reduces them
into possession,” <i>i.e.</i> captures them.</p>

<p>(3) That the sea and public rivers were not capable of individual
ownership.</p>

<p>(4) That no citizen could be prevented from fishing in the sea and such
rivers by any person. To this rule there are several exceptions; for
instance, (<i>a</i>) a cove of the sea bordering on a man’s land—perhaps if
enclosed with stakes, etc.—could be exclusively occupied for fishing
(<i>Digest</i>, 47. 10, ss. 13 and 14); (<i>b</i>) a right of fishing in a
recess or backwater of a public river could be acquired by prescription, and
would then be protected by a possessory Interdict against any one who
tried to fish this water (<i>Ibid.</i>, 44. 3. 7).</p>
</div>

<p>It is hard to define precisely what constituted a public river and what
a private river. Under the term “public” came all rivers of any size,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
not merely those that were tidal. Whether a river was public depended
not only on its size, but also on the “opinion of those dwelling around
it.” No river, periodically dry in summer, could be accounted public
(<i>Digest</i>, 43. 12, ss. 1-4).</p>

<p>All streams not public, many lakes, and all <i>piscinæ</i>, etc., were
private property, from which the owner could prevent any one taking
fish. The legal remedy for such exclusion, based on the ground of
trespass, was Interdict—a procedure very similar to that of Scotland,
whose law is mainly modelled on that of Rome.</p>

<p>The further legal question—were the fish in such <i>piscinæ res nullius</i>
or were they such individual property as to make any one taking them
without permission liable for theft—was answered by the jurist Nerva
in <i>Digest</i>, 41. 2. 3, <i>s.</i> 14, who held that they were individual
property—“pisces quos in piscinas coiecerimus a nobis possideri.”</p>

<p>Thus the owner of <i>vivaria</i> could proceed against a poacher by (1) an
interdict for trespass, and (2) a prosecution for theft, in case of a
fish being caught with the intention of taking it away. On the other
hand, a person prevented from fishing or navigating by another could
only proceed by an action of <i>Injuria</i>, personal affront (<i>Digest</i>, 43.
8. 17, <i>ss.</i> 8 and 9; 41. 1. 30; 43. 14, <i>s.</i> 7).</p>

<p>Although I purposely limit myself to a very slight sketch of Roman
regulations, the case reported by Pliny (<i>N. H.</i>, IX. 85) seems,
alike from legal and piscatorial interest, worthy of reproduction and
examination.</p>

<p>As the <i>Anthias</i> is one of the shyest of fishes, special precautions
and plenty of patience were necessary for a good catch. Thus fishermen
wore clothes of the same colour as their boats. They sailed without
fishing over the same stretch of sea. They merely went on “baiting the
swim” on each tack, day after day, till some spirit, bolder than the
rest, could be induced to take the bait. Still more days elapse before
the fish, which has by this time been well identified, is followed by
any of his mates. Eventually example proves so infectious that shoals
innumerable, of which the Elder Brethren even eat from the fisherman’s
hands, surround the boat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>Now is the accepted hour for “the fisherman to throw out a little
beyond his finger tips a hook concealed in bait,” and (to prevent
alarm) smuggle the fish out gently, one by one, by a very slight jerk.
His mate receives the fish on pieces of cloth, so that no floundering
about or other noise may scare their comrades. On no account must “the
betrayer of the others” be captured, lest instantly the shoal take to
flight and be no more seen.</p>

<p>But “there is a story that a fisherman, having quarrelled with his
mate, threw out a hook to one of the leading fishes, which he easily
spotted and with malicious intent captured. The fish was, however,
recognised in the market by his mate, against whom he had conceived
this malice: accordingly an action for damages (<i>damni formulam
editam</i>) was brought, which the defendant, as Mucianus adds, was
condemned to pay.”</p>

<p>Now, as shown above, (1) a fish is “res nullius,” (2) a fish becomes
the property of him who first “reduces it into possession,” (3) the
sea, with some exceptions which do not apply here, is not capable of
individual ownership.</p>

<p>If “the betrayer of his kind” was till malicious capture admittedly
and of set purpose left <i>free in the sea</i>, how could it have been
reduced into possession, how could any title in it have been acquired,
and, lastly—granted some kind of possession—by what <i>actio</i> or legal
formula could such possession have been enforced?</p>

<p>These points were to me a stumbling-block, till Professor Courtney
Kenny of Cambridge kindly came to my aid. As the extension here of
<i>Mansuefactio</i> is apparently unique, and would possibly have been
repudiated by jurists after Mucian’s time, we seem to be faced by a
novel point, which on account of its intricacy and interest will appeal
to people learned in the Roman Law.</p>

<p>The Professor’s letter runs: “Ownership in the <i>Anthias</i> must have been
created by that form of Occupatio of a res nullius, which consists,
not by the physical detention by angling, or by a piscina, but in mere
mansuefactio. This form is familiar for birds (<i>Dig.</i>, 41. 2. 3. 15:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
and for English Law, Bracton, 2. 1. 4): but for fishes I know of no
other passage than the one cited by you. Perhaps jurists, not so early
as Mucian, would have declined to admit that there had been a <i>true</i>
occupatio of this Anthias. The partner, who sold this fish, which was
partnership property, would be called on to account for it, and pay
over, in damages, his partner’s share of the price by the contractual
action Pro Socio. He might, in addition, be made to pay a penalty for
his wrong-doing in the delictual Actio Furti. For, though there was a
legal <i>primâ-facie</i> presumption (<i>Dig.</i>, 17. 2. 51) in favour of the
honesty of any partner in the sales of partnership-property, we are
here expressly told that he acted ‘maleficii voluntate,’ <i>i.e.</i> his
contrectatio of the fish was ‘fraudulosa,’ and therefore a Furtum. The
defrauded partner might well have brought both actions at once (<i>Dig.</i>,
17. 2. 45), but Pliny <i>speaks</i> only of his having brought the last named one.”</p>

Confirmation comes from Alciphron’s<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> statement that scarce a fathom
of the harbour of Ephesus but held a Net: on one occasion the sole

camel!<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<p>What and whence the Rod? It was certainly short: only from 6 to 8 feet
(Ælian, XV. 1)—a length which is in the main confirmed, if assuming
the height of some of the fishermen represented on vases, etc., in
the Greek and Roman rooms of the British Museum to be as high as six
feet, you then measure the rod. On the other hand, the sitting youth in
the Agathemeros relief (<i>Brit. Mus. Cat. Sculpture</i>, I. 317, No. 648)
measures 24 cm., the Rod 8 cm., the line 15 cm.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>As we do not possess any relic of the Homeric rod, the length of the
only one mentioned in either the <i>Iliad</i> or the <i>Odyssey</i> must be a
matter of conjecture, especially as this is styled περιμήκης, or “very
long” one.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p>The ordinary Rods were made of cane, hence <i>Harundo</i> and <i>Calamus</i>,
which was imported usually from Abaris in Lower Egypt, or of some light
elastic wood. For large and powerful fish, where something stronger
was required, Ælian tells us that <i>Tuncus Marinus</i> and <i>Ferula</i> were
preferred.</p>

<p>If the Rod were tapered, it was tapered probably by Nature not by art,
at least so the Agathemeros relief, all the pictures of Venus and Cupid
angling, and of many <i>Amorini</i> from Herculaneum would suggest. The
question whether the Rods were jointed has been discussed in my chapter
on the <i>crescens harundo</i> of Martial.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>The line, ὁρμιά, or <i>Linea</i>, made from the strong bristly hairs of
animals (<i>seta</i>) but most generally of horse-hair,<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>
of flax, of <i>sparton</i> out of the <i>genista</i>, perhaps of <i>byssus</i>, but
never of gut, was very finely twisted, as the epithet εὐπλόκαμος shows.
It was usually as long as the rod itself, although in the Agathemeros
relief we find it nearly double the length. The colours of the line
were grey, black, brown—sometimes red or purple. It was made tight to
the top of the Rod and not let down to the butt, or
running.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p>Plutarch prescribes that the hairs next to the hook should for
deception’s sake be taken from a <i>white</i> horse, and adds advice, as
pertinent now as then, that there “should not be too many knots in the
line!”<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p>To the line was fastened the hook (<i>hamus</i>) which was of one or two
sharp barbs.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> From Herculaneum,<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>
Pompeii, and elsewhere have been collected hooks which vary extremely in form, size, and method of
adjustment.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>
Although sometimes of bone, they are mostly manufactured from iron
or bronze. Cf. Oppian, III. 285: χαλκοῦ μὲν σκληροῑο τετυγμένον ἠὲ σιδήρου.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>It strikes us moderns as strange to have the epithet <i>hard</i> applied to
bronze and not to iron, till we are informed that the ancient bronze
was made of tin and copper, not zinc and copper, as is our softer
alloy, and was so hard that, Pliny tells us, it could be worked to
represent the finest hair of a woman’s head.</p>

<p>The Pompeian hooks were almost exclusively adapted for sea fishing, and
are thus generally large in size, long in shank, and flattened at the
top to facilitate attachment to the line.</p>

<div class="figleft">
   <a name="OLDEST" id="OLDEST"></a>

   <p class="f90">THE OLDEST<br />MYCENÆAN<br />HOOKS IN<br />THE BRITISH<br />MUSEUM.</p>
</div>

<p>Plutarch’s statement that some hooks were straight, as distinct from
the usual recurved sort, may possibly be indicative of a survival of
the palæolithic gorge. Some of the Roman hooks are double-barbed, some
are fixed back to back like eel-hooks, and fastened to wire to prevent
erosion by the teeth. In the pursuit of large fish such as the <i>Amia</i>,
hooks of a serpentine curve are recommended, “as these great fish
manage to get loose from straight ones!”</p>

<p>To the hook was fastened the bait (<i>esca</i>), usually worms, flies, and
other insects. For large fish the bait was often cooked, because the
scent was believed to offer an additional attraction. By a clever
contrivance of small pieces of lead equally balanced and carefully
attached the lure was made to have the appearance of natural movement.</p>

<p>The Reel on a fishing Rod was certainly unknown to Ancient Nations.
Wilkinson figures something resembling a Reel being employed when
spearing <i>hippopotami</i>.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Amia</i> (mentioned by Pliny, IX. 19, alone of all the Latin
writers) is according to Oppian<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>
a little smaller than the tunny, which reaches large proportions.
Later,<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>
he recounts how the <i>Amia</i> furnishes sad labour and trouble to the
fishermen from his habit, the moment he feels the hook, of instantly
rising, of swallowing more line, and then of biting through the middle,
“or even the topmost hairs of it.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>But successful cunning to avoid capture was no monopoly of the <i>Amia</i>.
Ovid, Oppian, Pliny, Plutarch, Ælian, recount numerous devices which
certain fish employ to nullify net or hook. I subjoin three of the
chief tricks used to defeat the <i>hamus</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Mugil</i>, whose greed is only saved by its guile, despite his
foreknowledge of danger has madly grabbed the bait, but keeps thrashing
it with his tail, till at last he shakes it free of the hook. “At mugil
cauda pendentem everberat escam Excussamque legit.”<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Anthias</i> on the first prick of the hook turns over on to his back
and quickly severs the line with his dorsal fin, or spike, “of the
shape and keenness of a knife.”<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Scolopendra</i>, according to Aristotle, “after swallowing the hook,
turns itself inside out until it ejects it, and then it again turns
itself outside in,” and (in Pliny’s words) vomits up everything inside
him till he has ejected the hook, and “deinde resorbet!”<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p>Lines with floating corks and lead attached close to the hooks, partly
to facilitate the throwing of the line, and partly, combined with a
sliding cork, to regulate the position of the bait, were in regular
use. Ground fishing, when the lure is leaded and thrown with or without
rod, was well known and widely exercised.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>Pastes and scents were also employed, either like myrrh dissolved in
wine to intoxicate (see the accompanying drawing, which is, I believe,
unique),<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>
or, like the cyclamen, or sowbread, to poison the fish.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>
From Oppian’s description of the workings of the poison, IV. 658 ff.,
we take the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Soon as the deadly Cyclamen invades</span>
<span class="i1">The ill-starred fishes in their deep-sunk glades,</span>
<span class="i1">... the slowly working bane</span>
<span class="i1">Creeps o’er each sense and poisons every vein,</span>
<span class="i1">Then pours concentred mischief on the brain,</span>
<span class="i1">Some drugged, like men o’ercome with recent wine,</span>
<span class="i1">Reel to and fro, and stagger thro’ the brine;</span>
<span class="i1">Some in quick circlets whirl: some ’gainst the rocks</span>
<span class="i1">Dash, and are stunned by repercussive shocks;</span>
<span class="i1">Some with quenched orbs, or filmy eyeballs thick,</span>
<span class="i1">Rush on the nets and in the meshes stick,</span>
<span class="i1">In coma steeped their fins more feebly ply,</span>
<span class="i1">Some in titanic spasms gasp and die.</span>
<span class="i1">Soon as the plashings cease and stillness reigns,</span>
<span class="i1">The jocund crew collect, and count their gains.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the simile—inevitable in Oppian—which ends the passage our author
may indicate, though he does not name, the Germanic tribes (for over
Rome in his day as over Europe in ours hung the barbarian menace) when
he condemned the abhorred habit practised by the enemy of poisoning the
springs and wells:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">... “the brave defendants sink</span>
<span class="i0">In thirsty pangs, or perish if they drink.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the number of methods, in the variety of devices, the fishermen of
Oppian and Ælian are not behind their modern successors; it is indeed
the reverse of</p>

We moderns are, in fact, merely the heirs to a piscatorial estate,
which by scientific improvement or intensive culture we have rendered
more serviceable and better adapted to the requirements of fish more
harried, and consequently more highly educated.</p>

<p>The old devices, the old recipes were never entirely lost.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>
They continued to be handed down through the Middle Ages, and may be
found in most of the collections of household recipes, such as those
of Baptista Porta, Conrad Heresbach, and others. They naturally in
the course of some thousand years got rather split up, or fell into
abeyance; it was not, in fact, till the seventeenth century that fairly
full collections of them began to reappear.</p>

<p>But except just to mention “tickling,” an ancient device in both Oppian
and Ælian, we have room here only for four methods, all very quaint,
either unknown or uncommon among twentieth-century fishers.</p>

<p>The <i>first</i>, that by which the goat-herd annexes the <i>Sargus</i>,
according to Oppian.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<p>In hot weather it was, and still is, in Sicily the wont of the
goat-herds to drive their flocks to some cool shallow of the sea. “Once
upon a time” one of them noticed that the <i>sargi</i> came round the goats
in vast shoals. The reason for this—whether grasped in a moment by
one great brain, or evolved by two or three generations of speculating
herdsmen—was discovered to be the attraction of the male <i>sargus</i> by
the smell of the female goat.</p>

<p>So the reasoning goat-herd slays his nanny, puts himself inside her
skin, and to perfect, I presume, the resemblance of the deception,
“adjusts on his brows the horns!” Then he gently glides into the
shallow, “scatters the food full shower” among the <i>sargi</i> hot on their
amorous mission and, well! for the number that were slain by “The
Sturdy Rod his latent Hand extends” I refer you to the fourth book of
the <i>Halieutica</i>!</p>

<p>Ichthyologists declare that the male <i>sargus</i> is very uxorious, and has
at least one hundred wives always in close-herded attendance on him. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
the words “unhappy lovers” indicate that the <i>sargi</i> were present not a
few, these multiplied by one hundred must have yielded quite a decent
creel.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p>The <i>second</i> method owes its success to the love for music and
for watching the dance, which Aristotle and Ælian assert to be
characteristic of several fishes, but especially of the skate. The
recipe of this method, far pleasanter, certainly less odoriferous than
that of the last, demands 1 Boat, 1 Violin, 1 big Net, 2 Men, one of
whom fiddles, while the other dances as he unwinds the net. Attracted
to the spot, and, like Wagner-devotees, so entirely absorbed by the
melody as to be unconscious of all else, the skates fall easy and
numerous victims to the slowly drawn net.</p>

<p>This method seems “the limit.” It certainly trenched on even Badham’s
credulity. He states that he would not have cited this statement of
Ælian’s, unless it had been “singularly countenanced and confirmed by
no less a person than the great French ichthyologist, Rondolet,” whose
mere name in this musical context must presumably carry conviction, for
(as is not unusual with Badham) no reference is given.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>third</i> method, employed by the Mysians for capturing the <i>Silurus</i>
in big rivers like the Danube and the Volga, is set forth by Ælian
(XIV. 25) in words which describe with such charming <i>naïveté</i> the
perfection of the Silurian palate, eye, and possibly nose, enabling
it to discriminate instantly between “the lungs of a wild” and other
“bull,”<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>
that we may venture upon quoting the whole passage:</p>

<p>“An Istrian fisherman drives a pair of oxen near the river-bank, not,
however, for the purpose of ploughing.... If a pair of horses are at
hand, the fisherman makes use of horses; and with the yoke on his
shoulders, down he goes and takes his station at a spot which he thinks
will make a convenient seat for himself, and be a good place for sport.
He fastens one end of the fishing-rope, which is stout and capable
of standing a good tug, to the middle of the yoke, and supplies the
oxen, or the horses, as the case may be, with sufficient food, and the
animals take their fill.</p>

<p>“To the other end of the rope he fastens a strong and terribly sharp
hook, baited with the lungs of a wild bull; this he throws into the
water as a lure—a very sweet lure—to the Istrian <i>silurus</i>, having
previously fastened a piece of lead of sufficient size to the rope
above the place where the hook is bound on, to serve as a support for
the pull.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>“When the fish perceives the bait of bull’s-flesh, he immediately
rushes at the prey, and, meeting with that he so dearly loves, opens
wide his great jaws and greedily swallows the dreadful bait; then the
glutton, at first turning himself round with pleasure, soon finds that
he has been pierced unawares with the aforesaid hook, and being eager
to escape from the calamity shakes the rope with the greatest violence.</p>

<p>“The fisherman observes this, and is filled with delight; he jumps from
his seat, and, now in the character of a fisherman, now in that of a
ploughman, like an actor who changes his mask in a play, he urges on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
his oxen or horses, and a mighty contest takes place between the
monster and the yoked animals; for the creature, foster-child of the
Ister, draws downward with all his might, while the yoked animals pull
the rope in an opposite direction. The fish can make no headway. Beaten by
the united efforts of the team, he gives in, and is hauled on to the bank.”</p>

<p><i>Siluri</i>, according to common report, have been caught weighing over
400 lbs. and of more than twelve feet in length.</p>

<p>There is good ground for us moderns patting ourselves on the back, when
we realise that owing to the many improvements effected in our tackle,
and not least in the Rod, an angler off Catalina has often landed a
heavier fish than a yoke of oxen on the banks of the Ister, <i>e.g.</i> Mr.
A. N. Howard (in 1916) caught the record Black Sea Bass in Californian
waters, weighing 493 lbs.</p>

<p>Even this big fellow is quite a dwarf beside the Tuna of 710 lbs. taken
in Canadian waters by Mr. Laurence Mitchell,<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>
which still holds, I believe, the record of the world as the very
largest fish ever taken on a rod.</p>

<p>I myself have seen a sword fish of over 300 lbs. killed on a rod off
Santa Catalina. When in 1909 out for Tarpon in Kingston Harbour,
Jamaica, I had the good luck to secure after a fight of two and a half
hours, and after being towed almost down to Port Royal and back, a
distance of some five miles, a shark weighing 116 lbs., with a rod only
8 foot long, with a light salmon line, with a No. 4 hook, and with a
bit of piano wire, <i>faute de mieux</i>, attached to prevent erosion.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<p>From the time of the earliest authors the identification of the
<i>Silurus</i> has been a vexed question.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>Aristotle writing of the <i>Glanis</i>, a large fresh-water fish (his only
account of actual fishing, it may be remembered, is a fight with a
<i>Glanis</i>),<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>
attributes to it characteristics and habits, which Pliny <i>totidem
sententiis</i>, if not <i>verbis</i>, transfers to the <i>Silurus</i>, although he
thrice mentions the <i>Glanis</i>. Ælian, in addition to XIV. 25, declares
in XII. 14, that the <i>Glanis</i> a species of, and very like, the
<i>Silurus</i>, while Athenæus treats them as separate fish.</p>

<p>As late as the time of Scaliger, the problem gave rise to discussion
which led to no elucidation of what fish exactly corresponds to the
classical <i>Silurus</i>. Perhaps the sentence of Albertus Magnus,<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
“a river fish which was called by the Greeks <i>Glanis</i>, but by us
<i>Silurus</i>,” seemed, although only a conjectural compromise, as near as
we could get to the identity.</p>

<p>Agassiz, however, reluctant to accept Cuvier’s identification of the
<i>Glanis</i> with the <i>Silurus glanis</i>, came to the conclusion (after
examining six specimens of a Siluroid new to Ichthyologists, which
he obtained from the Acheloüs in Western Greece) that from agreement
in the form of the anal fin, the position of the gall bladder, the
connected spawn, etc., they were the same as Aristotle’s <i>Glanis</i>.
To this Siluroid Agassiz gave the name <i>Glanis aristotelis</i>: it is,
perhaps, better known as <i>Parasilurus aristotelis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a></p>

<p>If the <i>Silurus</i> be the <i>Scheid</i> of Germany, his strength, habits, and
ferocity, as set forth in our authors are indeed very credible. From
Aristotle we learn that this “river fish” is easy to hook (as we should
suspect from its rapacity, which has been tersely summarised in “pisces
pisci præda at huic omnes”), but from its huge powers and hard teeth
very hard to hold.</p>

<p>The passage in Pliny, IX. 75, which he extracts from
Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>
—“Silurus mas solus omnium edita custodit ova, sæpe et quinquagenis
diebus, ne absumantur ab aliis”—has by a wrong rendering accorded to
the male <i>Silurus</i> the proud distinction of being the only male fish
that guards its eggs. This is absurd, for other instances, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>Chromis simonis</i>, exist.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>Where fish, however, pay any regard whatever to their <i>ova</i>, it is
usually, but not always, on the father that the duty falls. “Omnium”
in Pliny is to be read not with “solus” but with “edita ova.” This
reading advances the quite different claim that the Silurus is the
only male that includes in its watch and ward not merely its own but
promiscuously also the eggs of other fish. Perhaps the same start of
surprise awaits him, on the pentecostal and last day of his vigil, as
that of the hen when she first beholds a mixed brood of chickens and
ducklings emerging from under her breast.</p>

<p>Pliny reveals some fabulous uses of the <i>Silurus</i>. In XXXII. 28, fresh
caught <i>Siluri</i> are an excellent tonic for the voice. In 46, by the
smoke and scent of a burnt <i>Silurus</i>, especially one hailing from
Africa (!), the pangs of childbirth are said to be greatly eased. In
40, for curing “ignes sacros” or the malady of St. Anthony’s fire,
the application of the bellies of living frogs, or of ashes from a
<i>Silurus</i>, were two of the nostrums recommended.</p>

<p>The <i>fourth</i> and last method, for the capture of Eels, given by
Ælian,<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>
although almost certainly cribbed from Oppian,<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>
but with a local habitation and a name carefully thrown in to suggest
originality, reads much as follows:</p>

<p>The eeler from a high bank of the “river Eretaenus, where the eels are
the largest and by far the fattest of all eels,” lets down at a turn of
the stream some cubits’ length of the intestines of a sheep. An eel,
seizing a bit of it at the nether end, tries to drag the whole away,
on which the fisher applies the other end (which is fixed to a long
tubular reed serving the place of a fishing rod) to his mouth, and
blows into the sheep’s gut. This presently swells; the fish receiving
the air in his mouth swells too, and unable to extricate his teeth is
lugged out, adhering to the inflated intestines.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gin these be joys of artful eeling, oh! gie me Essex Flats,” with
their “sniggling for eels with a needle,” or “banding“ for fish with
whitethorn hooks!</p>

<p>In addition to this pneumatic method of Ælian others were employed for
taking eels. Stirring up the mud, in which they were wont to lurk was
a common device; hence the proverb ἐγχέλεις θηρᾶσθαι, to fish in muddy
waters. Thus Aristophanes<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
makes the sausage seller, whom the Whigs of Athens had hired to
outbawl the demagogue Cleon, shout, “Yes, it is with you as with the
eel-catchers; when the lake is still, they do not take anything, but if
they stir up the mud, they do; so it is with you, when you disturb the
State.”<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></p>

<p>Even at the risk of being likened to Mr. Bouncer of Oxford fame,
who in every answer of his Divinity paper dragged in his sole and
cuff-attached bit of Old Testament knowledge with “and here it may not
seem inappropriate to subjoin a list of the Kings of Israel and Judah,”
I venture some comments on the Eel.</p>

<p>The frequent allusions in our authors to the Eel, (A) as a sacred fish,
(B) as the delight of the epicure, and (C) as a propagator of its
species in a variety of surprisingly erroneous ways, must be my excuse.</p>

<p>(A) <i>It was held as a god</i>, or at least as a sacred creature, by the
Egyptians,<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>
as sacred to Artemis in the spring of Arethusa,<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>
and semi-sacred by the Bœotians.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></p>

<p>Antiphanes<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>
ridicules the Egyptians for the sacred honour paid to the fish, wrongly
termed by the Greeks the Eel. Contrasting the value of the gods with
the high prices paid for the fish at Athens he gibes; “they say that
the Egyptians are clever in that they rank the Eel equal to a god, but
in reality it is held in esteem and value far higher than gods, for
<i>them</i> we can propitiate with a prayer or two, while to get even a
smell of an Eel at Athens we have to spend twelve <i>drachmæ</i> or more!”
Anaxandrides’<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> makes a Greek say to an Egyptian:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i1">And we a mighty dainty!”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Juvenal in Satire XV. (written probably after his return from
semi-exile in Egypt) lashes with ridicule the compatriots of his butt
Crispinus. The enumeration of their animal and vegetable gods is a fine
specimen of dignified humour. By <i>piscem</i> in line 7, may be indicated
the <i>Oxyrhynchus</i>, the <i>Lepidotus</i>, or the <i>Phagrus</i>, the so-called
Eel—three sacred fishes of the Nile.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Illic æluros, hic piscem fluminis, illic</span>
<span class="i1">Oppida tota canem venerantur, nemo Dianam.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>(B) <i>As a delicacy</i>, the Eel by the Greeks was rated very high. But
the reverse held good at Rome. Unlike its cousin the <i>Muræna</i> it gets
little commendation by the Latin comedians—Terence’s in <i>Adelphi</i>,
377-381, is the solitary exception I can recall—and by the gourmets.
Apicius deemed it worthy of but one recipe.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>“Vos anguillæ manet longæ cognata colubræ” (Juvenal, V. 103) is
often quoted as stamping the low position of the Eel at Rome, but in
reality, as the whole context bears out, this particular “cousin of the
snake” was condemned not because of its kinship, but because it was
<i>Cloaca</i>-bred and drain-fed.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>

<p>The passage in Menander’s,<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> <i>Drunkenness</i> which makes one of the
characters declaim that, were he a god, he would never allow a loin of
beef to load his altars, unless an Eel were also sacrificed, testifies
to the preference for the Eel to meat. Numerous are the pæans of praise
rendered by Greek writers to the superlative excellence of the fish.</p>

<p>The Eel is dight “the King of fish”<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>;

<p>Whether this was applied because the fish was the personification of
all delicate dainties, as Helen was the fairest of all the fair, or
because every guest strove like Paris to supplant his neighbour and
keep her all to himself, the reader must choose. Athenæus certainly
leans to the latter view.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

To the sense of smell as well as that of taste the <i>Murænidæ</i> appealed
strongly, to judge by the eulogy that their bodies when being cooked
exhaled an odour fragrant enough to restore the sense of smell in the
nose of a dead man! while, if boiled in fine brine, they “changed the
human nature into the divine!”<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p>The luxurious and lazy Sybarites, who felt they had broken their
bones if they but saw another digging, and suffered not a cock in the
whole country, lest he should mar their slumber, were so passionately
addicted to Eels that all persons catching or selling them were exempt
from taxes and tribute.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>

<p>(C) <i>The propagation of Eels</i>: This has given birth to more
theories—all of them till some twenty years ago quite erroneous—than
any other ichthyic question. From Aristotle downwards nearly every
zoologist, nearly every writer on fish, has advanced his view as to how
and whence eels are bred.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></p>

<p>Only a few of them, and they all divergent, can find space here.
Aristotle held that Eels had never been found with milt or roe, that
when opened they did not seem to possess generative organs, and
that apparently they came from the so-called entrails of the earth,
seemingly referring to certain worms formed spontaneously in mud and
the like.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

Pliny, after making the assertion (taken, as usual, from Aristotle)
that among fish the females are larger, and often the more numerous,
goes on, an echo once more of “His Master’s Voice,” to deny to the Eel
sex, either masculine or feminine: according to him, Eels when they
had lived their day, rubbed themselves against the rocks, and their
scrapings came to life: “they have no other mode of procreation.”<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></p>

<p>Von Helmont attributed the birth of Eels to the dews of May mornings!
other authors deduced their parentage from the hairs of horses! others
again from the gills of fish! while the great Izaak Walton insisted on
spontaneous generation!<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p>

<p>To solve the insoluble, recourse was, as usual, had to the gods: thus
Jupiter and a white-armed goddess yclept Anguilla<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>
(the Latin for Eel) were accounted parents of the countless “cousins to the snake.”</p>

<p>Theory was piled upon theory, false conclusions were drawn from
falser data. Even as late as 1862 appeared an author, not one whit
less certain of the truth of his discovery based “on a series of
observations extending over sixty years,” or one whit less active in
asserting it, than any of his numerous predecessors.</p>

<p>In <i>The Origin of the Silver Eel</i>, Mr. D. Cairncross propounded the
following assertion: “The progenitor of the silver Eel is a small
beetle: of this I feel fully satisfied in my own mind, from a rigid and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
extensive comparison of its structure and habits with those of other
insects.”<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>
“The beetle in the act of parturition” is represented on the <a href="#FRONT">frontispiece</a>!</p>

<p>The fact that this beetle is evidently a dead one would not, as the
<i>Bibliotheca Piscatoria</i> rather wickedly puts it, even if known to the
writer, cause him to alter his opinion one jot!</p>

<p>It was only in 1896—strange, indeed, that a problem which so many
keen intellects had attacked should remain unelucidated for over two
thousand years!—that the mode of reproduction and development of the
Eel was first surmised, and then for the most part ascertained by
Professor Grassi and Dr. Galandruccio. But not till 1904 were most of
the surmises of the Italian investigators placed beyond question, and
the mode of reproduction, etc., established beyond doubt by Johann
Schmidt of Copenhagen.</p>

<p>The now accepted view (stated shortly) is as follows: fresh-water Eels
approach maturity when about six years old, and then change their
colour from browny-yellow to silver, whence “Silver Eels.” In this
bridal attire and with eyes enlarged, they find their way from the
rivers to the sea, and far out into deep waters of the ocean. The
pace at which they travel on their way to the sea cannot be computed
exactly, but two marked Eels have been caught whose record was nineteen
kilometres in two days. Meek<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>
states that neither the exact locality nor the approximate depth of
the spawning is as yet known, but that there can be no doubt that
the spawning region lies deep and far out in the Atlantic beyond the
Continental shelf.</p>

<p><i>The Times</i>, Sept. 25, 1920, announces that Dr. J. Schmidt has just
discovered the spawning place of fresh-water Eels to be not far S.
of Bermuda, or about 27 deg. N. and 60 deg. W., much farther W. than
he anticipated. Of the many marvels of the ichthyic world this is,
perhaps, the greatest. It taxes, it transcends, our powers adequately
to conceive the hereditary instinct or gauge the enduring strength
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
which impels fish—as yet sexually undeveloped—of only moderate size
to traverse 3000 or 4000 miles of an ocean full of foes, and to seek,
especially to find, the only area which contains the requisite depth,
temperature, and currents favouring the procreation and the return home
of their minute but parentless progeny.</p>

<p>The conclusion is now clear that the Eels of Europe at any rate
have a spawning area in common; the two Italian doctors were wrong
in supposing that Eels spawned in the Mediterranean. In such ocean
depths certainly below, probably far below, the one hundred fathoms<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>
line the generative organs of the Eels develope, and in due though
protracted time the females spawn.<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></p>

<p>Their eggs float for a time; the young, when hatched out, pass
through a metamorphosis and are known in one stage as <i>Leptocephalus
brevirostris</i>. This larval form, which is flat and transparent and has
a very small head, drifts with the ocean currents towards the coasts
of Europe, where it passes through a series of metamorphoses into the
Elver or young Eel, which in March and April swims up English rivers.
The fecundity of the Eel, were it not for the system of check and
countercheck devised by Nature, would in time become a danger; for the
ovary of a female thirty-two inches in length has been estimated to
contain no fewer than 10,700,000 eggs!<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></p>

<p>But however legitimate or illegitimate their methods may seem, all
praise should be rendered to our ancient anglers. Especially so, when
we call to mind that, as they possessed not running lines, reels,
gut, nor probably <i>landing</i> nets, the playing of large fish must have
required more delicate manipulation and the landing presented far
greater difficulties than to us, armed as we are with all these and
many other appliances.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class="h_subtitle">THE NINE FISH MOST HIGHLY PRIZED</span></h3></div>

<p>I subjoin a list of the nine fish which found most favour in Greece and
Rome. This, although necessarily rough and tentative, can (I believe),
be justified by an examination of our authors.<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>
To anyone who on the strength of one author may be dissatisfied with
the place allotted to a particular fish, I would point out that since
the oracles of taste vary with the ages, it is essential to hold in
mind the exact date at which a passage was written.</p>

<p>Then, again, the Greek saw not eye to eye, or ate not tooth to tooth,
with the Roman. The verdict of the opsophagists or, as these often
differed, of the plain people of one century not infrequently reversed
that of the last.</p>

<p class="space-below2">As with us at the present day it is hardly feasible to
adjudge definitely to what fish belongs the primacy of palate, so was it with
the ancients. In the case of the Greeks the task is impossible. Every
one of our nine can boast at least half a dozen champions. Then, again,
as regards the epoch of individual supremacy we are without any guiding
statement, such as Pliny’s that in his time the <i>Scarus</i> was reckoned
the king of fish.<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></p>

For these reasons, discount as we may the personal predilections of an
author like Ennius, of a <i>gourmet</i> like Apicius, of a <i>bon vivant</i> like
Vitellius, any list is perforce approximate, not absolute. It must be
governed by the dictum of the great Greek epicure, χαίρει γὰρ ὁ μὲν τούτοις, ὁ δ’ ἐκείνοις.</p>

<p>But if our opsophagists disagreed as to which was <i>the</i> best fish, they
were fairly unanimous as to which part of a fish was best. Setting
aside the peculiar partiality of the Greeks for the head of the Conger,
the part near the tail afforded the most savour, and found the most
favour with ancient (and modern) <i>gourmets</i>.</p>

<p>Three reasons for this preference have been suggested:</p>

<div class="blockquot1">
<p>(A) That from Xenocrates. After laying down that fish roasted are more
nutritious than fish boiled, that sea fish are easy of digestion and
by their formation of blood impart a good colour to the skin, that
fish from lakes and rivers are generally bad for the stomach, form
thick juices, and are difficult of evacuation, this great physician
affirms emphatically that the part near the tail of <i>all</i> kinds of fish
(Nonnius excepts the Tunny) are the most wholesome, on account of it
being most frequently exercised.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a></p>

<p>(B) That from Pliny. Writing of the <i>Muræna</i>, he says that it is quite
clear that in its tail abides its <i>anima</i> (‘life’ or ‘being’), because
a blow on that part swiftly kills it, while one on the head is more
tedious in effect.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></p>

<p>(C) That alleged in Scandinavia. To the Norseman the most delicate
part of the salmon was its tail. His choice, nowadays by no means
exceptional, was explained by a pretty piece of ætiological tradition.
Loki, fleeing from the pursuit of the gods whose anger he had provoked,
had the wit and the time to transform himself into a salmon. Then and
in this guise would he have surely escaped, had not Thor caught him by
the tail, “and this is the reason why salmon have had the tails so fine
and so thin ever since.”<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
In my list, which excludes the <i>Echineis</i>, despite its being according
to Cassiodorus<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>
“that honey of flesh, that dainty of the deep,” in precedence comes 1
the <i>Mullus</i>, 2 the <i>Scarus</i>, 3 the <i>Acipenser</i>, 4 the <i>Rhombus</i>, 5 the
<i>Lupus</i>, 6 the <i>Asellus</i>, 7 the Eel and the <i>Muræna</i>, 8 the κάπρος, 9
the Sole.</p>

<p>1. <i>Mullus</i> (<i>M. barbatus</i>), the “Red Mullet.” The passages already
quoted as regards the huge prices sometimes given for it establish
the extreme esteem with which this fish was regarded. But if need
be, witness after witness to credit can easily be called. Perhaps,
as regards the Latins, Nonnius will suffice: “Inter omnes pisces
prærogativa quadam omniumque consensu Mullus sibi imperium occupavit,
nec alius unquam majori in honore aut gratia apud Romanos fuit.”<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></p>

<p>Among the Greeks, if, as seems acknowledged, the τρίγλη corresponds to
the Mullet, its place must be accounted high from the number of its
devotees. Matron<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>
goes into raptures even over its mere head when steeped in brine,
irrespective of whether it came from an autumn (as recommended by
Aristotle) or a spring fish (the choice of Xenocrates).</p>

<p>The acme of epicurean hospitality was reached with serving the Mullet,
not dead swimming in sauce, but alive swimming in a globe of glass,
to be handed round among the guests. All eyes gloated as its gay hues
gradually grew dimmer, till at last with death they faded into one dull colour.</p>

<p>Seneca lashes with his bitterest irony the custom, and the company.
They are no longer content to satisfy their teeth and their
stomach—no, they must also gratify their eyes. “No one now sits with
a dying friend. None can bring himself to witness the death, however
much desired! of his father. The last hours of brother or kinsman find
no soul with him. To the death of the Mullet have they all flocked with
one accord.”<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></p>

<p>2. For the <i>Scarus</i> (<i>S. cretensis</i>), the “Parrot Wrasse,” <a href="#Page_159">see Chapter X</a>.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Acipenser</i>, a Latin name, adopted by some Greek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
writers, which is often, if not convincingly, identified with the
<i>Sturio</i>, the “Sturgeon,” and by Archestratus<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>
is affirmed but wrongly, to be the γαλεός, enjoyed a long and glorious
reign of supremacy from the early times of the Republic down to
Vespasian. For it alone, with perhaps one exception, was reserved the
high honour of being served at a banquet to the music of flutes and
pipes, crowned itself, borne by slaves likewise
crowned.<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a></p>

<p>Its praise and its price (Varro styles it <i>multinummus</i>) seem alike
exorbitant. We find the name of Gallonius the glutton-auctioneer, the
first to bring the fish into fashion, occurring again and again.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>
On Ovid’s (<i>Hal.</i> 134) “Tuque peregrinis acipenser nobilissimus” may be
piled passage upon passage. Plautus in a fragment of his <i>Bacaria</i><a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>
asks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Quis est mortalis tanta fortuna affectus umquam</span>
<span class="i1">Qua ego nunc sum? quoius hæc ventri portatur pompa:</span>
<span class="i1">Vel nunc qui mihi in mari acipenser latuit antehac,</span>
<span class="i1">Quoius ego latus in latebras reddam meis dentibus et manibus.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Cicero—no fish story-teller he—makes at least four references to it.
In <i>De Fato, frag. 5</i>, he sets forth the tale of the Acipenser (‘piscis
... in primis nobilis’) presented to Scipio, to whom, as he persisted
in inviting all and every one who saluted him, Pontius anxiously
whispered, “Do you know what you are about? Lo! this is a fish fit only
for a few choice palates!”</p>

<p>As to its decline from its high estate, Pliny’s definite assertion (IX.
27), “Apud antiquos piscium nobilissimus habitus acipenser ... nullo
nunc in honore est,” finds corroboration by Martial, XIII. 91:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Ad Palatinas acipensem mittite mensas;</span>
<span class="i1">Ambrosias ornent munera rara dapes.”<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
The <i>Elops</i> or <i>Helops</i> has been deemed to be the <i>Acipenser</i>,<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>
but this conflicts with Ovid (<i>Hal.</i>, 96)—“Et pretiosus elops <i>nostris
incognitus undis</i>”—with Columella (VIII. 16), and with Pliny (XXXII. 54).</p>

<p>Whatever the <i>Elops</i>, Varro and Epicharmus testify to its extortionate
price, while Pliny lets us know that by many of the <i>cognoscenti</i> its
flavour was deemed to be the very best of all.</p>

<p>The capture of this rare and elusive fish—its usual habitat was off
Pamphylia—became the occasion of great rejoicing; the crew of the
successful boat were crowned with wreaths, and welcomed by the music of
the flute-players.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>
It is noteworthy that the <i>Acipenser</i> does not occur in the pages
either of Varro or of Columella, while the <i>Elops</i> does.</p>

<p>4. The <i>Rhombus</i>, whether it were <i>R. maximus</i>, the “Turbot,” or <i>R.
lævis</i>, the “Brill,” has been long in dispute.</p>

<p>Juvenal describes his celebrated <i>Rhombus</i> with “erectas in terga
sudes” (IV. 128); “erectas” may be conceded to the licence of a poet as
regards the back fin of a Turbot, but not of a Brill, which is yielding
and rather wavy. Then, again, Diphilus declares that its flesh is
soft, Xenocrates that it is firm, and improves with keeping. Now the
flesh of the Brill is soft: that of the Turbot much firmer. <i>Rhombus</i>
(unmentioned by Aristotle) probably stood for both Turbot and Brill, as
well as for the ψῆττα, “which is called by the Romans the <i>Rhombus</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p>The fish, which derives its name from its supposed likeness to the
geometrical figure, was in poetry but not in popularity<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>
more celebrated than that other famous flat fish, the Sole. As a dainty
the Sturgeon was in vogue long before the <i>Rhombus</i>, perhaps because,
as Horace (<i>Sat.</i>, II. 2. 49) suggests, it was introduced by a man of fashion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

It ran often to immense size. Martial’s fish (XIII. 81), although
“latior patella,” can hold no candle to the one presented to
Domitian.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></p>

<p>That Emperor, though deeming himself and insisting on his subjects
acclaiming him, of godlike attributes, was not equal to solving the
knotty question of how to cook and to serve his fish <i>whole</i>, “Derat
pisci patinæ mensura”—if its proportions were in the same street with a
<i>Rhombus</i> vouched for by Rondolet, <i>viz.</i> three metres long, two broad,
and one thick, the fact excites no wonder—so he straightway summoned a
special meeting of the Senate.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></p>

<p>Discover, Montanus advises, a new Prometheus capable of modelling the
amplest trencher instantly, but, since to a god like Domitian (he
flatteringly adds), offerings of huge fish will frequently be made—</p>

<p>5. The <i>Lupus</i><a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>
—<i>Labrax lupus</i>—“common Bass” at Athens enjoyed the choicest
preference. Aristophanes absolutely refused to be disturbed while
feasting on a Milesian <i>Labrax</i>. Archestratus eulogises it as
“god-begotten” (θεόπαιδα). During the early Roman Republic it indeed
ranked (with the <i>Asellus</i>) only second to the
<i>Acipenser</i>.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>The fish throve best and grew fattest in sewage; hence those “from
between the two bridges” of the Tiber were famed far and near; see
Horace, <i>Sat.</i>, II. 2, 31; Macrobius, <i>Sat.</i>, II. 12; and Juvenal,
V. 103-8. The latter’s “et solitus mediæ cryptam penetrare Suburæ”
was rendered quite clear only in 1743, when the remains of the Cloaca
leading from the low-lying ground to the Tiber were excavated. From
this greedy scavenging he is christened by Lucilius (<i>Sat. 4, frag</i>.,
127, Baehrens) “the platter-licker” (catillo)—</p>

<p>The Doctors once more are at variance. The Court, unanimous that (in
Walton’s phrase) “its savour was excellent,” only by a majority (Galen
and Celsus J.J.) upheld its nutritive powers, Hicesius J. dissenting.
Rondolet against the volume of authority affirms that the <i>Lupus</i> of
the sea is of better quality than that of the river. Pliny<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>
dubs the <i>Lupus</i> “lanatus”—not from his woolly appearance, or woolly
taste, but from the whiteness of his flesh—<i>laudatissimus</i>. But by the
time of Domitian it has fallen from its proudest place.</p>

<p>Its Aristophanic title of “the wisest of fish” was earned by its
cunning in escape from net or hook; its method in the case of the
former is vouched for by Cassiodorus,<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> and of the latter by Ovid:<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a></p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Pliny, commenting on the marvellous friendships and hatreds which exist
among fish, instances the astounding combination of both in the <i>lupus</i>
and the <i>mugil</i> (grey mullet), “who burn with mutual hate for some,
yet live in concord for other, months of the year”—despite the cheery
custom, hereditary in the <i>lupus</i>, of nibbling off the tail of the
<i>mugil</i>; all, however, live, “quibus caudae sic amputentur.”<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>6. The <i>Asellus</i> has been identified as the <i>Gadus merlangus</i>, the
“Cod;” and as the <i>Merluccius vulgaris</i>, the “Hake,” by Scaliger and
Rondolet, and by Hardouin with some doubt.</p>

<p>It cannot be the Cod (although Dorion speaks<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>
of “the ὄνος which some call the γάδος”), because hardly any of the
<i>Gadidæ</i>, except the Hake, frequent the Mediterranean on account of the
temperature of the water. Nor can the <i>Asellus</i> be the Hake, because,
while the latter is taken <i>all the year round</i>, Pliny<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> and Ælian<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>
distinctly state that the <i>Asellus</i> hides in the heat of summer.</p>

<p>This assertion, if the ὄνος be the same as the <i>Asellus</i>, tallies with,
probably indeed derives from, Aristotle’s remark that it is the only
fish that hides itself in a hole in the ground in the hot weather, when
the Dog-star rages.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>
The fish, Varro informs us, is called <i>Asellus</i> from the ashen
colour of its scales, resembling that of the coat of an
ass.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<p>If there be doubt as to its classification scientifically, there is
none gastronomically. Laberius and Cornelius Nepos ranked it only
second to the <i>Acipenser</i>. Ovid (<i>Hal.</i> 131) enters a demurrer
against the name given in:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Et tam deformi non dignus nomine asellus.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Galen warmly commends the fish for its quality of flesh, and great
nutritive power; in these respects, indeed, he places the Mullet, the
<i>Lupus</i>, and Sole far below. Xenocrates, whose dictum usually differs
from his successor, depreciates it, as does “nobilis ille helluo”
Archestratus, whose palate pronounced the flesh “spongy.”</p>

<p>A sovereign remedy for fever and ague are “the small stones found in
the head of the Asellus, when the moon is full, and attached in linen
to the patient’s body!”<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>7. The <i>Muræna</i>—<i>M. serpens</i> or <i>helena</i>—(frequently but quite
erroneously called the “Lamprey”), with whose taming, teaching, and
fighting I have dealt, was on the <i>menu</i> a most welcome and eagerly
anticipated item.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></p>

<p>Of the <i>Murænidæ</i>, at Athens the Eel, at Rome the <i>Muræna</i> was, as
the last chapter shows, the greater favourite. Archestratus, it is
true, commands men of taste to buy at all hazards the <i>Muræna</i> of “the
Straights”<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>;
but the Latin authors sing its praise frequently and fervently.</p>

<p>The comparative want of appreciation of the Eel at Rome may have been
merely masculine, and evolved from the Latin boy (<i>prætextatus</i>)
regarding “this cousin of the snake” not as a dainty for his palate,
but as a scourge for his body! Early association counts for much in
later life: so his back’s memory of a flogging with a whip made of
eel-skins, twisted tightly together, may have caused the male adult
to approach delicately, or not at all, the fish with his freeborn
palate.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a></p>

<p>At the <i>tripatinium</i>, which marked the height of delight at a
supper,<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>
the <i>Muræna</i> gave the choicest morsel. Horace, Martial,
and others not only sing its fame, but give its proper dressing. To
Martial’s taste that from Sicily ranked first, but Varro—was it
because these, as Suidas asserts, were the largest?—votes for the
Spanish fish.</p>

<p>While Apicius (X. 8) hands down various recipes for the proper frying
and boiling of the other parts, he distinctly discards, on account
of its reputed poisonous properties, the head of the <i>Muræna</i>. But
among the Greeks direction follows direction for cooking the Conger’s
“exquisite head.” Philemon rhapsodises over—

<p>8. The κάπρος—by some identified with the <i>Aper</i>, by some translated
the “Sea-Hog.” Neither scientifically, nor in my list can I place this
fish; it was apparently unknown to the Romans.</p>

<p>Of the fish as <i>Caper</i>, except in Ennius,<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>
“Caproque apud Ambracienses,” and Pliny, XI. 112, “et is qui caper vocatur,”
Latin literature is silent. Nor do these two quotations aid, because the
first occurs in the poet’s imitation or translation of Archestratus
(Apul., <i>Apol.</i>, p. 384), while Pliny simply transliterates Aristotle’s
κάπρος.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p>Of its right to be near the top of the list, the words of Nonnius bear
high proof: “Among the fishes which the Greeks sought with mad desire,
and at any cost to procure, was first and foremost the κάπρος, which,
though called <i>Aper</i>, was unknown to the Romans.”</p>

<p>Archestratus<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>
outdoes even himself in his eulogy of this fish, for he
straightly enjoins any one lucky enough to be in Ambracia,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Buy it at once, and let it not escape you,</span>
<span class="i1">Not if you buy it at its weight in gold;</span>
<span class="i1">Else will the indignation of the gods</span>
<span class="i1">O’erpower you: for ’tis the Flower of Nectar.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The immediate sequel to these lines is of interest. The poet,
transported from earth to heaven at the thought of his favourite
dainty, describes it in wording which recalls the most solemn rites of
Hellenic religion. There were certain foods reserved for communicants.
There were mysteries which none but advanced initiates might witness.
There were objects of peculiar sanctity borne by virginal ministrants.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
There were divinatory pebbles shaken in the glittering caldron of Apollo.
These sacred associations are all suggested by the language of our enthusiast:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“It is not meet for every man to taste,</span>
<span class="i1">Nor see it with his eyes. Nay, he must hold</span>
<span class="i1">The hollow woven-work of marsh-grown wicker</span>
<span class="i1">And rattle pebbles in his glittering count.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the words, though reminiscent of actual cult, have a double
<i>entendre</i> and are meant to bear a more mundane meaning. In plain
prose, then, “it needs a wealthy man with capacious cash-box (literally
a basket, <i>fiscus</i>) and a rattling big bank-account (pebbles to reckon
L. S. D.) to afford such a luxury as this!”</p>

<p>Not far behind it among Greek epicures came the <i>Glaucus</i>, possibly the
sea-grayling, of whose “most precious head” Anaxandrides is enamoured,
and Antiphanes and Julius Pollux write with appreciative gusto. But are
not all things about the <i>Glaucus</i> written in the seventh book of the
<i>Deipnosophistæ</i>, chapters 45, 46, and 47?</p>

<p>9. The <i>Buglossus</i>, or <i>Lingulaca</i> (<i>Solea vulgaris</i>, the “Sole”<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>),
alike at Rome and at Athens the most prized, if not the most lauded in
verse, of the Flatfish, held rank as high as any, actually far higher
than its so-called cousin, the <i>Passer</i>.</p>

<p>Although Xenocrates and Galen differ as to the firmness or reverse of
its flesh—I wonder whether the latter got hold of a Lemon Sole!—the
ancient agrees with the modern faculty in accounting it “very
nourishing, and of most pleasant flavour.”<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>
It then as now was almost always the first fish ordered, “as soon as
men be sick or ill at ease“ in Plutarch’s time and words.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>From likeness to a tongue sprang its first Greek and Latin names; from
likeness to a sandal its second, σανδάλιον and solea. Thus we find
Matron<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>
establishing, or merely perpetuating, the pretty myth that these fish,
possibly from some adhesive power—and is it heresy to suggest their
breadth?—served the Goddesses of Ocean as sandals or shoes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Σάνδαλα δ’ αὖ παρέθηκεν ἀειγενῆ ἀθανατάων</span>
<span class="i0">Βούγλωσσον, ὂς ἔναιεν ἐν ἅλμη μορμυρούση.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>As Yonge renders them—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And next (the goddesses such sandals wear)</span>
<span class="i1">Of mighty soles, a firm and well-matched pair,”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>the verses have the double demerit of being uncomplimentary to
Aphrodite <i>et Cie</i>, and of reading into Matron an allusion unwarranted
by his lines.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

<p>A not dissimilar use of the Sole is instanced in Polynesian theology.
Ina the daughter of Vaitooringa attempted flight to the sacred island.
Fish after fish essayed to bear her thither, but unequal to the burden
dropped her in the shallow water. At last she besought the Sole, who
managed to carry her as far as the breakers. Here, again unshipped,
she lost her divine temper, and stamped with such fierceness on the
head of the unfortunate helper of distressful maids that its under eye
was squeezed right through to the upper side. “Hence the Sole is now
obliged to swim flat on one side of its face, having no eye.”<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></p>

<p>Plautus puns or makes play on <i>Solea</i>, which means, first, a shoe or
sandal (as does σανδάλιον), and, second, the fish, and <i>sculponeæ</i>, a
kind of wooden shoe (which Cato<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>
remembers being worn only by country folk) often employed for striking a
person.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>Then comes the other play on <i>Lingulaca</i>, which in its first sense
equals a chatterbox, and in its second the fish.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Lysidamus</i>: Soleas. <i>Chalinus</i>: Qui, quæso, potius quam sculponeas,</span>

</div></div></div>

<p>To render the double punning of these lines has been a task too hard
even for the excellent Loeb Library. But Badham, perhaps <i>poeta
nascitur</i>, but here <i>non fit</i>, comes to the fore:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Fresh tongues for sale, who’ll buy, who’ll buy?</span>
<span class="i1">Come, Sir, will you? No, friend, not I;</span>
<span class="i1">Of tongue enow at home I’ve got</span>
<span class="i1">In my old wife, Dame Polyglot.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The <i>Cestreus</i>, or <i>Mugil</i>. My inclination to include this fish among
“The Nine Fish most highly prized” was checked in part by Faber’s
placing it only in Class II., and in part by the possible reproach,
seeing that the glories of its cousin the Mullus had been fully
recounted, of “too much one family.” But as the fish possesses traits
very individual, if not always engaging, and as Athenæus devotes to
its gastronomic and other properties no less than four chapters,<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>
I cannot pass by it without some comment.</p>

<p>Its edible qualities vary with the place of its capture. While the
<i>Mugil</i> of Abdera, Sinope, and other clear-watered places achieved
high praise, its more frequent but muddy-tasting brother of the
lagoons formed the staple of one kind of τάριχος. Their predilection
for lagoons and brackish water—evidenced by writers as far apart as
Aristotle and Apostolides (1900 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>)—came about possibly
from the fish “breeding best where rivers run into the sea,” or can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
accounted for by the belief that “Some of the grey mullet species
are not produced by copulation, but grow spontaneously from mud and
sand.”<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></p>

<p>Apart from characteristics already mentioned, <i>e.g.</i> its greed and
guile, its hereditary feud with the <i>Lupus</i>, its being “the swiftest
of fishes” (which attribute, nevertheless, saved it not from being the
prey of the slowest, if not the shrewdest of fishes, the <i>Pastinaca</i>
or sting-ray,<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>)
we find various points of interest noted by ancient writers:</p>

<p>(A) “Whilst rain is wholesome for most fishes, it is, on the contrary,
unwholesome for the <i>Cestreus</i>, for rain and snow superinduce
blindness.”<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></p>

<p>(B) The passionate desire of the <i>Cestreus</i>, when about to spawn,
“renders it so unguarded” that, if a male or female be caught, fastened
to a line, allowed to swim to sea, and then gently drawn back to
land, shoals of the opposite sex will follow the captive close up
to the shore and fill the awaiting nets.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>
This method of fishing, which prevails at Elis at the present day, is
but one, as Apostolides indicates, of the many survivals in modern
Greece of the ancient craft.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a></p>

<p>(C) The <i>Mugil</i>, together with three others, possesses by far the best
sense of hearing, “and so it is that they frequent shallow water.”<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a></p>

<p>(D) The <i>Mugil</i>, anticipating the ostrich, hid its head when
frightened and fancied that the whole of its body was concealed.
Unlike the ostrich, however, it has long got cured of its “ridiculous
character”<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>,
for, as Cuvier remarks, this trait in modern times has not been observed.</p>

<p>(E) The <i>Mugil</i>, although vouched for as the greediest and most
insatiable of feeders, attained paradoxically the sobriquet of Νῆστις,
or <i>the Faster</i>.</p>

<p>The epithet probably gained currency from the stomach of the fish
(like that of most salmon caught in fresh water) rarely being found to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
contain food. This perhaps may be accounted for by the great length
of its gut, throughout which the filmy garbage and vegetable matter
forming its chief diet are inconspicuously disposed. “The Cestreus is
fasting” even became a proverb and was applied to men who lived with
strict regard to justice, because—as Athenæus explains—the fish is
never carnivorous.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a></p>

<p>(F) The use in cases of adultery of the <i>Cestreus</i> in Greece and
the <i>Mugil</i> at Rome, if not singular among fish, is striking;
for it survived into the civilised age of Catullus (“percurrent
raphanique mugilesque,”)<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>

Indeed, traces of the same barbaric custom still exist
among certain tribes on the West Coast of Africa.</p>

<p>Gifford writes: “the being clystered (as Holyday expresses it) by a
Mugil was allowed by no written law, but it seems to have been an
old and approved method of gratifying private vengeance. Isidorus
thinks that the fish was selected for this purpose on account of its
anti-venereal properties, but he confounds the <i>Mugilis</i> with the
Mullet.”<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></p>

<p>From <i>The Fisheries of the Adriatic</i>, a most elaborate Report by Faber
on the kinds and market values of the fishes of that sea, I give the
class allotted to the fish of my list. It must once more be impressed
on the reader that these eight fish (for of course Faber does not deal
with the kάpros), were the most renowned in Greece and Rome. Of these,
five only—the Mullet, <i>Acipenser</i>, <i>Rhombus</i>, <i>Lupus</i>, and Sole—are
in Class I.; the <i>Asellus</i> and <i>Muræna</i> in II.; the <i>Scarus</i>, and it
could not be lower, in III.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p>The classification disappoints and depresses, especially in the case of
the vaunted and lovable <i>Scarus</i>. It tempts, however, to an insoluble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
sum in proportion. If about these and other less esteemed fish the
books extant and known to have been lost are almost as countless
as the smile of Ocean, how many volumes would an Englishman or an
American—given the same fish-mania and the same literary facility as
the Greeks—require to do justice to his wealth of first-class edible
fish? Verily the Library of Alexandria, with its room for 400,000
volumes, would scarce suffice.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class="h_subtitle">FISH IN MYTHS, SYMBOLS, DIET, AND MEDICINE</span></h3></div>

<p>Although the salutary warning—<i>Terminat hora diem: terminet auctor
opus</i>—forbids us prolonging the Greek-Roman section, already
disproportionate in space, yet the part played by fish (A) in myths,
(B) in symbols or emblems, Pagan or Christian, (C) in medicine, and (D)
in diet necessarily demands some notice.</p>

<p>And as our authorities are, in the main, writers in Greek and Latin,
this section seems the appropriate place for what must, although the
literature on the subject is superabundant, be summary and restricted
comment.</p>

<p>By the Solar Mythologists, the fish (no creature, however small,
escapes the mesh of their net) has been made to take a prominent
<i>rôle</i>. The fair-haired and silvery moon in the ocean of light is
simply the little gold-fish; the little silver-fish which announces
the rainy season is merely the deluge. The gold-fish and the luminous
pike, like the moon, seem to expand and contract, and in this form,
as expanding or contracting, the god Vishnu or Hari (perhaps meaning
“fair-haired” or “golden”) refers now to the sun, now to the moon,
Vishnu being held to have taken the form of the gold-fish.</p>

<p>“The epic exploits of fishes,” to borrow de Gubernatis’s term, would
include the myths of Adrikâ, the fish nymph who became the mother of
Matsyas, the king of fishes; of the Puranic fishes, symbolical and
natural; of the fishes of the Eddas, with the scaly transformations of
Loki, and hundreds of similar legends.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>The vagaries of Solar Mythology can be safely neglected. But the story,
derived perhaps from Semitic sources, of fish incarnation and of the
adventures of Manu, is deserving of fuller consideration.</p>

<p>According to one variant of the legend, Vishnu, in the form of a small
fish, approached Manu to beg protection against the larger fish;
whereupon he was placed securely in a water-jar, but in a single night
outgrew the jar. Manu then tried a pond, and next the Ganges, but
similar increases in size compelled him to remove the fish to the sea.
Upon this the god made himself known, warned the sage of the coming of
the Flood within seven days, and bade him build a ship and furnish it
more or less on the lines of the Jewish Ark, only among the passengers
were to be seven Sages!</p>

<p>In accordance with his promise, Vishnu, still in fish shape, reappeared
on the subsidence of the waters, and with a rope attached to his horn
towed the Ark to the Northern Mountain, where it grounded.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a></p>

<p>Instances of impiscation (so to speak) appear not infrequently in my
pages. Oannes, with head and tail of fish, but also with human face and
feet; Dagon, “Sea-monster, upward man and downward fish”; Atargatis, or
Derceto, “with face of woman but body of fish”; Venus, turning herself
and Cupid—and also, as one account adds, her lover Mars—into fishes
to escape the pursuit of the Giants;—all these can be grouped with
other myths.</p>

<p>These tell us that Asia was saved by a fish and is supported by a
tortoise, that Polynesia was brought up, itself a fish, on a fish-hook
out of the primæval ocean, or that America was rescued from the depths
of diluvian chaos by a turtle. Well may Robinson conclude, “Since
in the beginning there were only Light and Water, the eldest of the
Zoological Myths is the Fish Myth.”<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></p>

<p>According to de Gubernatis,<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>
“the ancient systems of mythology have not ceased to exist: they
have been merely diffused and transformed. The <i>nomen</i> is changed;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
the <i>numen</i> remains. Although from loss of celestial reference and
significance its splendour is minished, its vitality is enormous.” We
find, however, that the mythic motives or original principles common to
India and Hellas (as well as Scandinavia, etc.) are most conspicuous
among the Greeks. India, indeed, seems absolutely wanting in some which
in Europe manifest extraordinary vitality and expansion.</p>

<p>But in any comparative enumeration, strict regard must be paid to the
fact that the fauna of a myth commonly varies with its geography; as an
instance of this, the epos, which in Europe recounts the cunning of the
fox, in India dilates on the craft of the serpent.</p>

<p>The fish myth proved no exception. It passed from nation to nation
gradually down the ages, till we find the Greeks, borrowers sometimes
unconsciously, sometimes of set purpose, perpetuating it widely in
connection with deities and sub-deities.</p>

<p>Thus came it about that to several of the greater gods of the Greek,
and afterwards of the Roman, Pantheon appertained a particular fish (or
fishes). These not only enjoyed their gods’ protection, but also the
double distinction of being at once an attribute represented with them
and a sacrifice offered to them.</p>

<p>The association of certain gods with certain fishes is not always
obvious. While the linking of Amphitrite with the Dolphin, or of
Poseidon with the Tunny is easily explained by legends of hoary
tradition, it needs all the ingenuity of Eustathius to decipher the
connection between Artemis and the <i>Mainé</i>.<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

<p>In time, as their coins indicate, fish became associated with various
coast towns, which owed their prosperity to fishing. Good examples
descend from Olbia, Carteia, and Cyzicus on the Propontis. The early
electrum coinage of the last shows the badge of this or that magistrate
invariably accompanied by a Tunny, the badge of the state.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>
Very remarkable<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>
is an electrum <i>stater</i> with a Tunny upright between two sacrificial
fillets, which may signify that this tunny was closely connected with
some deity or was itself of a sacro-sanct character.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>Even more remarkable is a coin of Abdera in Hispania Bætica. This
carries on its obverse a laureat head of Tiberius: on its reverse a
four-pillared temple, two of the columns of which are in the form of
fish. This unique representation has never been fully explained.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a></p>

<p>It is surely a happy coincidence that on some mintages of Imperial date
the fish occurs together with the head of some self-styled deities,
such as that choice couple, Nero and Domitian. On sundry pieces struck
by Nero, the octopus-like and predatory Sepia not inappropriately finds
place; but monstrously incongruous seem the coins which associate
the man-serving and man-saving Dolphin with the self-serving and
man-slaying Domitian.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<p>With the Jews, although its emblematic employment was scanty, the fish
occasionally figured, <i>e.g.</i> as a sign of Judah. In the Talmud it
appears more frequently, and as symbolic of some moral quality—<i>e.g.</i>
of innocence.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>
In Japan the carp has been for centuries the emblem of the Samurai,
because of its accredited power to withstand opposition and to swim
against the current of the stream.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>On the advent of Christianity, numerous become the allusions in
Patristic and other literature. From the repetition by Father after
Father of <i>Aquæ vivæ piscis Christus</i>, of <i>piscatio duplex, Ecclesia
præsens et futura</i>, and of similar sentences, the application
approaches perilously near the commonplace.</p>

<p>Nor was its scope morally limited. St. Augustine, St. Cyprian, and
others allegorise fish and fishing in both good and bad senses.</p>

<p>Thus, <i>piscis pia fides quæ vivit inter fluctus nec frangitur</i>; <i>piscis
fides invisibilium</i>; <i>rete Christus</i>; <i>sagæna Ecclesia</i>; <i>Christus est
piscis assus discipulis, serpens Judæis</i>, can be matched by <i>pisces
immundi, peccatores</i>; <i>piscis maris, dæmones</i>; <i>piscator Diabolus</i>;
<i>rete, deceptio Diaboli</i>; and <i>sagæna, cor mulieris</i>, which last,
from a technical point of view, hardly stamps Bishop Humbertus as a
proficient in our craft.</p>

<p>From the identification—<i>Christus est piscis</i><a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>
—is no long step to the symbolic use of the very letters which spell
the Greek word for fish: thus from ΙΧΘΥΣ = I-ch-th-u-s, is established
Ἰησοῦσ Χριστὸς θεοῦ υἱὸς σωτήρ, or “Jesus Christ, of God Son, Saviour.”</p>

<p>This symbolic adoption in connection with their God was far from
original. A fish, at first the symbol of Vishnu, was adopted by the
Buddhists, and from them by the Christians of Turkestan.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>
This adoption and adaptation of a Pagan symbol was but one of the many
instances where Christian policy or Christian practice took over and
continued heathen customs, institutions, and vestments.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>Such seems to have been the trend, possibly from pursuing a policy of
compromise, more probably from following the line of least resistance,
of most religious changes or revivals. But while the attributes of
many of the Greek gods were, at least in certain of their attributes,
assimilated to Syrian and Eastern divinities, and while the Roman
pantheon made room for various Egyptian new-comers, the Jew’s
conception of his Deity remained practically unaffected and uninfected.</p>

<p>A fish frequently figures on the tombs of the early Christians in the
catacombs at Rome: sometimes it bears on its back a bowl with wine and
wafers of bread. Many tombs contain small fish of wood or ivory. Such
fish served, we are told, as emblems and acrostics, pointing out to his
co-religionists the burial place of a Christian without betraying the
fact to the persecutors.</p>

<p>This explanation lacks confirmation, and carries little conviction,
for two (among other) reasons. First: critical statistics show that
fish as symbols in Christian art figured frequently both before and
after Constantine. Second: fish as indicative of a burial place would
by their very presence quickly defeat the object aimed at. They would
indicate, as surely as pointers game, the secret grave, for the persecutors
 of the Christians, as history shows, were not all exactly fools.</p>

<p>Some authors trace back not a few of the signs<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>
and usages adopted and perpetuated by the Christians to the worship of
Venus, of which, when in conjunction with a fish, the underlying idea
was the adoration—nearly universal—of fecundity. Two instances, which I
give for what they are worth, must suffice.</p>

<p>As regards Lent, A. de Gubernatis contends that Aphrodite or Venus, the
goddess of Love<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>,
frequently represented the Spring. Hence it is that in Lent, appointed
by the Church to be observed in Spring, and again on Friday (or the day
of Freya) we are enjoined to eat fish, of which, it must be remembered,
Aphrodite was a patron goddess.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>As regards Maunday Thursday, Robinson writes: “One of the annual Church
disbursements up to the end of the sixteenth century was for herrings,
‘<i>red and white</i>.’ Let us hope that those who in pious observation
of Christian ordinances thus charged themselves with phosphorus were
not aware that they were simply perpetuating the worship of Venus.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>
Friday, again, is <i>dies Veneris</i>, and fish, her own symbol, is
therefore appropriate for the day.”</p>

<p>Of the making and explaining of symbols in early and mediæval times
there is no end. The monkish mind, perhaps owing to environment and
fasting, found this a congenial and pleasant pursuit.</p>

<p>Among the books on this subject, <i>Mundus Symbolicus</i>, although, or
perhaps because, published in 1681, attracts me most, not merely by
its fulness of information and of quotation from classical, Patristic,
and mediæval literature—it is a good competitor with Burton’s
<i>Anatomy</i> for <i>Collectanea</i>—but also by the number and <i>naïveté</i> of
its <i>lemmata</i>, or appropriate apophthegms, which appeal alike to one’s
ignorance and one’s humour. Of 737 pages of the volume before me 43
concern themselves solely with fish, and provide delightful browsing.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p>

<p>The object and practice of Picinelli, from whose <i>Il Mondo Simbolico</i>
Erath makes the Latin translation, is to examine into the habits,
real or alleged, of each fish, and deduce, as was the frequent
custom of books in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, from its
delinquencies or virtues a moral lesson or lessons.</p>

<p>Thus the <i>lemma</i>, “<i>Fallacis fructus amoris</i>,” not inaptly summarises
the amatory character of the <i>Sargus</i>, as indicated in my chapter on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Tackle. Nor, again, is the author far astray with his <i>lemma</i> for
the <i>Monachus</i> or Monk fish (a name derived from the hood on its
head)—“<i>Habitum non virtutem</i>”—which recalls the mediæval jeer, “The
cowl makyth not the Monk,” and Oscar Wilde’s description—half-echoing
Browning—of the pike as “some mitred old bishop <i>in partibus</i>.” Of
the Monk fish—also Bishop fish—a well intended representation can be
found in the pages of the learned Gesner.</p>

<p>Under <i>Salmo</i>, when suffering from leeches or gill-maggots, the author
provides us not only with the <i>lemma</i>, “<i>Hæret ubique</i>” and the
appropriate, if not quite original, reflection of St. Bernard that
conscience is like the leech which ceaseth not night nor day from
making its presence felt, but also with a vivid description of a kelt
dying—“<i>donec toto corpore tabescat</i>.”</p>

<p>Any connection between a salmon and a swallow (<i>hirundo</i>) for a moment
seemed a new ichthyic revelation! The context, however, and not least
St. Bernard’s pointing of the moral, led to the discovery of the
misprint of <i>hirundibus</i> for <i>hirundinibus</i> (‘leeches’).</p>

<p>With one more passage I regretfully leave Picinelli, or rather Erath.
The collocation of the rose and fish held in the hand of Cupid, which
Alciatus “<i>non sine mysterio instruxisset</i>,” occasioned “the erudite”
and anonymous epigram (p. 671) showing that Love resembles the rose and
the fish. This apparent incongruity finds explanation thuswise: while
each has prickly points, the first fades in a day and the second is
incapable of being tamed—a comparison which, if unique, ignores the
Egyptian and Roman powers of domestication.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

One lemma “<i>Pingit et delectat</i>” is not the author’s happiest effort.
That attached to the only illustration of a man fishing—<i>Tenet et
tenetur</i>—tersely depicts the happy angler.</p>

<p>Many instances illustrating the importance attached to fish, both in
diet and in medicine, are to be found scattered through my pages. I
would, however, wager that in addition to these multiplied even one
thousandfold, there would yet remain in the pages of medical<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>
and other writers (even if we stop as early as Aëtius) matter sufficient
for a large Monograph.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p>

<p>In one book alone of Pliny’s (XXXII.) fish are recommended as remedies,
internal or external, no less than (according to my rough reckoning) 342 times!</p>

<p>If Hippocrates, “the father of Medicine,” in the fifth century
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> (<i>c.</i> 460-359) laid the foundation, Galen some six
centuries later (131-201 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) crowned the edifice of that
science. The cry and the practice of the former, “Back to Nature,” was
energetically enjoined and brilliantly defended against the inevitable
reactions of the Alexandrian and other schools by the latter, who
acclaims his predecessor as “divine.”</p>

<p>In his insistent teaching “Ensue Health,” as the one and only thing
alike for patients and physicians, Galen<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>
might well have adopted the last line of Ariphron’s glorious pæan to Health:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">μετὰ σεῖο, μάκαιρ’ Ὑγίεια,</span>
<span class="i0">τέθαλε πάντα καὶ λάμπει Χαρίτων ἔαρι</span>
<span class="i0">σέθεν δὲ χωρὶς οὔτις εὐδαίμων ἔφυ.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In his own case success crowned his efforts. He boldly boasts that he
did not desire to be esteemed a physician, if from his twenty-eighth
year to old age he had not lived in perfect health, except for some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
slight fevers, of which he soon rid himself.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>
Perhaps a secondary motive was not absent, viz. the desire to avoid the
taunt so often levelled at medical men:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">ἄλλων ἰατρὸς αὐτὸς ἔλκεσιν βρύεις,</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>which Urquhart in his <i>Rabelais</i> translates,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“He boasts of healing poor and rich,</span>
<span class="i4">Yet is himself all over itch!”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>As regards fish as a diet in health and sickness, <i>quot medici, tot
sententiæ</i> seems hardly exaggeration. Their wondrous unanimity as
regards the food-properties of the Eel amazes, for with fish it was
usually a case “where doctors disagree.”</p>

<p>The “Father of Medicine,” in denouncing its use (especially in
pulmonary cases) was followed by nearly all medical writers, some
of whom, however, were not slow, when otherwise differing from him,
to assert that he killed more folk than he saved by his practice of
leaving Nature to effect its cure. Paulus Jovius sums up historically
the medical attitude towards Eels: “abhorred in all places and at all
times, all physicians do detest them, especially about the solstice.”</p>

<p>As Galen’s dictum<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>
that fish afford the most desirable food for “the idle, the old, the
sick, and the silly” embraces the majority—if we allow Carlyle’s
“mostly fools”—of mankind, it would be idle to pursue the dietetic
side, were it not for the <i>distinguos</i> (to use the old Schoolman’s
term) as to which fishes fell within or without the Mysian’s category.</p>

<p>Diphilus (with Philotimus and others) speaks disparagingly of some,
but highly recommends others. <i>Habitat</i> alone, he urged, formed the
deciding line between the clean and unclean. His <i>Treatise on Food for
the Well and Ill</i><a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>
divides sea-fish into (A) those which keep near the rocks—these, in
his words, “are easily digested, juicy, purgative, light, but not very
nutritious”—and (B) those which haunt deep water—these are “much less
digestible, very nutritious, but upsetting to the internal economy.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>Alexander Aphrodisiensis attributes the superiority of Class A to the
fact that, as the water round the rocks is in perpetual motion, its
denizens continuously exercise themselves.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a>
Galen, for a somewhat similar reason, appraises as the lowest in
nutriment the inhabitants of marshes, lakes, and muddy waters, because
of their lack of swimming exercise and their impure food.</p>

<p>A further subdivision commends itself to Rhazes. All fishes rough of
scale, mucilaginous and white-coloured are best; those of a black and
red shade must be avoided.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>
A special <i>distinguo</i> extends to the part of fish, as Xenocrates plumps
for the tails, on account of their being most exercised! Bonsuetus,
centuries after Galen, echoes him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“All fish that standing pools and lakes frequent</span>
<span class="i1">Do ever yield bad juyce and nourishment.”<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But however divided the ancient practitioners were in their estimate
of the digestibility of a fish diet, or of particular fishes, in
their ichthyic remedies internal or external they credulously and
enthusiastically coincided. Hence rained piscine prescriptions in every
form, fresh, salt, cooked, calcined: every part and tissue, flesh,
bones, skin, trail, brains, gills, <i>viscera</i>, and teeth—each and all
were regarded as specifics against some human disease or infirmity.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></p>

<p>All ailments practically find a cure in the ichthyic panaceas or
nostrums which render old medical tomes boresome from repetition, and
yet at times diverting. In regular prescriptions and old wife recipes
alike, fish play a prominent part.</p>

<p>Have you been bitten by a mad dog, and need a theriac? Dioscorides’
recommendation,<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>
as amplified by Pliny, is “pickled fish applied topically, even where
the wound has not been cauterised with hot iron; this will be found
sufficiently effectual as a remedy”!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>Do you suffer from toothache? Then you must have omitted to rub your
teeth once a year in the brains of a dog-fish, boiled in oil and kept
for the purpose!</p>

<p>If, however, this and other remedies disappoint you, Dioscorides<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>
and Celsus<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>
come to your aid with the sting of the <i>pastinaca</i>, which, applied with
hellebore or resin, extracts the teeth painlessly! As a dead certainty,
if the ichthyic kingdom fail to give relief, “attach two frogs to the
exterior of your jaw”!</p>

<p>Health, perfect health, should be the lot of every woman who follows
the Plinian precepts in Book XXXII. 46.</p>

<p>Is she helpless from hysteria? “Lint, greased with a dolphin’s fat, and
then ignited,” produces an anti-excitant; or, if the case yield not to
treatment instantly, “the flesh of the <i>strombus</i>, left to putrefy in
vinegar” is an excellent alternative!</p>

<p>If an easy delivery be desired, “first”—the prescription smacks of
Mrs. Glasse—“catch your torpedo-fish at the time that the moon is in
Libra, keep it in the open air for three days,” and then, as soon as it
is introduced into the patient’s room, the trick is done! Pregnancy, on
the other hand, proves often abortive, if the woman “happens to step
over <i>castoreum</i> or over the beaver itself,” or misuses a <i>Remora</i>.</p>

<p>For dyeing the hair black calcined <i>echineis</i> with lard, or
horse-leeches boiled in vinegar, are cheap and trustworthy recipes. For
depilatories your choice is wide. The blood, gall, and liver of the
Tunny, fresh or pickled; or merely the liver, pounded, but preserved
with cedar-resin in a leaden box<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>;
the <i>Pulmo marinus</i>, the Sea-hare, according to Dioscorides (<i>De mat.
med.</i>, ii. 20), the <i>Scolopendra</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, ii. 16); or “the brains of
the <i>Torpedo</i> applied with alum on the sixteenth day of the moon!”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>Two more panaceas—needful and desirable now, as then—and I move to
pastures new, or rather contiguous. The first: a mixture “of a live
frog in a dog’s food” will, on Salpe’s authority, for ever deliver us
from the yapping and barking which so often makes night hideous.</p>

<p>The second—naïvest and quaintest (if I may employ without cruelty
these over-driven adjectives): “Democritus assures us that if the
tongue be extracted from a live frog, with <i>no</i> part of the body
adhering to it, and it is then applied—the frog must <i>first</i> be placed
in the water(!)—to a woman while asleep, just at the spot where the
heart is felt to beat, she will of a certainty answer truthfully any
question put to her!”<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a></p>

<p>If Hippocrates blamed his predecessors for their scanty use of
drugs, he would scarcely, unless suddenly clothed with a shirt of
credulity, have approved of the plethora of prescriptions and panaceas
prevalent in later centuries. Truly applicable would then have been
the inscription suggested for a pharmacy; “Hic venditur galbanum,
elaterium, opium, et omne quod in <i>um</i> desinit, nisi remedium.”<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></p>

<p>But credulity clogged such great minds as Hippocrates and Galen.
Even they included astrology in the therapeutic art, and indict
practitioners who only used that “science” despitefully, or eschewed
it, as “men-killers.”</p>

<p>Quite apart, however, from the recognised prose treatises by iatric
writers such as Galen, Diphilus, and Xenocrates, there must have
existed a very ample literature in Greek verse. One collection alone,
<i>Poetæ Bucolici et Didactici</i> (Didot, Paris, 1872), reveals under
the heading of <i>Carminum Medicorum Reliquiæ</i> the names of some dozen
authors who deal chiefly—Marcellus Sidetes indeed exclusively—with
the medicinal properties of fish.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>Cursory skipping of these fragments compels, even if one’s acquaintance
with ancient medical writers be slight, ready assent to the opinion
of the learned editor (p. 74) that originality was not the dominant
characteristic of their begetters. They are apparently, with two
exceptions, but metrical plagiarisms or excerpts—not quite as bad as
Tate and Brady’s <i>Translations of the Psalms</i>—from the works of Galen
and others.</p>

<p>The first exception, the medical oath (ὅρμος ἰατρικός) startles our
modern conceptions. The practitioner swears that he will administer
none of the poisons, some of the deadliest of which, as we have seen,
were piscine.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<p>The second is a fragment from a medical work by Marcellus Sidetes. In
the days of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, despite the stirring times
described by historians, Life (to alter the well-known verse) must
verily have been a watch and a vision—or rather a yawn—between a
sleep and a sleep to many a reader, for no less than forty-two volumes
were necessary to contain the hygienic hexameters of our author. But
more astonishing even than the leisure required for their perusal, the
whole forty-two (according to Suidas) were held in such high esteem
that by command of the Emperors they were placed in all the public
libraries of Rome.</p>

<p>In our fragment, <i>Remedies from Fish</i>, Marcellus, after prefacing that
by long study he has acquainted himself with their medicinal effects,
sets out a list of healing fish. He adds here and there some leading
specific. To one of these he prettily makes us privy, <i>e.g.</i> the
application of a burnt mullet, mixed with honey, in cases of carbuncle.</p>

<p>But our author must not be written down as a one-ideaed fish-quack; for
that Nature works cures (if not miracles) by the agencies of earth, and
of “broad-wayed air,” as well as of the sea, is a firm tenet of his
faith.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the Greeks and Latins aphrodisiacs and antaphrodisiacs, <i>i.e.</i>
incentives to, or prophylactics against love, were accounted of
potency, and meet with frequent mention. Each kingdom of Nature,
animal, mineral, vegetable, piscine, was impressed to compass these
purposes.</p>

<p>The list submitted by Pliny—a weighty natural historian, mark you!—of
those drawn from the first would be scouted by any modern Obeah or
Ju-ju man, however powerful, as taxing too severely the credulity of
his ignorant <i>clientèle</i>. Even Haitian superstition would reject its
obvious absurdities. “The ashes of a spotted lizard”—here even the
compiler is compelled to caution ‘si verum est’—“held in the left hand
stimulate, but in the right kill desire,” ranks far from being the most
incredible of the prescriptions.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>

<p>The Ancients specialised not only in gods, but also in fishes which
made, or made not, for passion. We, however, while enjoying a hundred
sects, have brutally boiled down our aphrodisiacs to one, stout and oysters!</p>

<p>The salacious properties of many fishes—inherited or acquired,
according to ancient legends, from their mother or protectress,
Aphrodite—furnish the theme of classical authors, grave and gay;
<i>e.g.</i> of Epicharmus in <i>Hebe’s Wedding</i>—at wedding feasts fish were
an absolute essential; of Varro,<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>
<i>tunc nuptiæ videbant ostream Lucrinam</i>; of Plautus,<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>
where at the marriage of Olympio the old man in love orders the purchase
of stimulating fish.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Emito sepiolas, lopadas, loligunculas.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Even Pythagoras, according to Lilius Giraldus, believed that cupidity
could be aroused, not by fish, which were apparently banned to his
disciples, but by <i>Urtica marina</i>.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a></p>

<p>Pliny’s list of proved aphrodisiacs and antaphrodisiacs includes among
the former “the eye-tooth of a crocodile attached to the arm,” and
among the latter “the skin from the left side of the forehead of the
hippopotamus attached fast to the body in lambskin.”<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">DIOCLETIAN’S EDICT, 301 A.D.—PRICES OF FISH<br />AND OTHER ARTICLES THEN AND NOW</span></h3></div>

<p>Struck with Adam’s words with regard to the Edict of Diocletian, 301
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>—“if we could fix the value of the denarius at this
epoch, the prices of fish then would prove an interesting subject for
comparison with those now (1883) current at Billingsgate”—I set to
work to ascertain how great had been the depreciation of and what was
the exact value of the denarius at the opening of the fourth century.</p>

<p>Much labour would have been saved, had I earlier come across Abbott’s
<i>The Common People of Ancient Rome</i>, but I found some compensation in
the solution of my sum coinciding approximately with his estimate of
the denarius = ·4352 cent.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></p>

<p>The Edict of Diocletian<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>
contains, as Mr. Abbott (to whose book I am indebted for very much that
follows) indicates, many points of great economic interest to us at the
present time.</p>

<p><i>First</i>—sentences of the Introduction (probably from intrinsic
evidence written by the Emperor himself) might well pass for a diatribe
in to-day’s paper against a Beef or other Trust. Fortunate it is for
these that the newspaper man possesses not the power of life and death
wielded by Diocletian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>The Emperor, having decided that the prices promulgated shall be
observed in “all our domain,” goes on, “it is our pleasure that if any
shall have boldly come into conflict with this formal statute, he shall
put his life in peril. In the same peril also shall he be placed, who,
drawn by avarice in his desire to buy, shall have conspired against
these statutes. Nor shall he be esteemed innocent of the same crime
who, having articles necessary for daily life and use, shall have
decided that they can be held back, since the punishment ought to be
even heavier for him who causes need, than for him who violates laws.”</p>

<p><i>Second</i>—the prices are <i>maximum</i> prices, not for commodities
only, but also for wages.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>—although the number of slaves owned had decreased since
Augustan days, the scale of wages was still distinctly affected by
slaves being hired out by their owners for day or job work.</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>—the absence of power being applied to manufacture, of the
assemblage of men in a common workshop, and of the use of any other
machines than the hand loom, or the mill for grinding corn.</p>

<p><i>Fifth</i>—for the urban workman in the fourth century (as Mr. Abbott,
p. 176, demonstrates), conditions of life must have been almost
intolerable. It is indeed hard to understand how he managed to keep
body and soul together, when almost all the nutritious articles of
food were beyond his reach. “The taste of meat, fish, butter, and
eggs must have been almost unknown to him, and even the coarse bread
and vegetables on which he lived were probably limited in amount. The
peasant proprietor who raised his own cattle and grain would not find
the burden so hard.”</p>

<p><i>Sixth</i>—the failure within a dozen years of the Emperor’s bold attempt
to reduce the cost of living. Lactantius,<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>
writing in 313-14, sums up the result of this interference with
economic check and countercheck—“for the veriest trifles much blood was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
shed, and out of fear nothing was offered for sale, and the scarcity
grew much worse, until after the death of many persons the law was
repealed from necessity.” Sixty years later the Emperor Julian made a
similar but smaller attempt to control prices, but the corn speculators
of Antioch so entirely worsted him that he had to acknowledge defeat.</p>

<p>By the courtesy of the Secretary of the Fishmongers’ Company I was
furnished, with some average <i>wholesale</i> prices for 1913, the last
year unaffected by the war. The consumer, it must be remembered, is
compelled, in general, to pay the retailer one-third per lb. more to
defray handling, rent, etc.</p>

<p>The following sea fish were sold in London, per lb., as follows: Cod
for 4, Turbot for 9½, Mullet (<i>Mugil capito</i>) for 11, Sole for 17
pence. In the Edict the price of fresh sea fish is lumped at from 4½ to
7 pence, so we have no datum for comparison of individual prices. In
the case of the <i>Mugil capito</i>, however, we are enabled to contrast its
price, <i>i.e.</i> 11 pence, with that in Egypt, <i>c.</i> 1200 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
<i>i.e.</i> <small><sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub></small> of a
penny.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a></p>

<p>A comparison with America in 1906 shows that the average price of fresh
sea fish was from 4<i>d.</i> to 7<i>d.</i> per lb., or practically the same as in
Diocletian’s time, while that of river fish—fresh—per lb. was 6 to 7½
as against 3¾ pence in the Edict.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></p>

<p>Salt fish, per lb. in 301 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> cost 4¼<i>d.</i>,
in U.S.A. 4<i>d.</i> to 7½<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Oysters (by the 100), 1<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>, (in London) 4/-to 14/-.</p>

<p>The figures show that prices of other commodities in the Edict vary
extremely, but for sea fish are not far apart.</p>

<p>From the articles of raw material and manufactured wares, which number
in the Edict over eight hundred, and from the wages, etc., I subjoin
some items and prices on account of their general interest.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a></p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ROMAN AND MODERN PISCICULTURE</span></h3></div>

<p>With the opinion held by some, that the method of breeding fish
employed by the Romans was practically the same as that of the modern
Pisciculturists, Badham<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>
seems to agree, when he remarks: “The plan of stocking rivers with fish
<i>ab ovo</i> has been, after the lapse of many centuries, revived by two
Vosges fishermen, Gehin and Rémy,” and “they have thus re-established
a very ancient practice, and succeeded in stocking the streams of France.”</p>

<p>But this is a total misconception. It can only have arisen from
ignorance either of what is found in Latin writers, such as Columella,
or of what is the nature of the method used by Rémy and, with great
improvements, by present Pisciculturists.</p>

<p>Shortly, the Roman method collected from the bottom of a river or a
marsh eggs, already fertilised in the natural manner by fish, and
removed them to other lakes or <i>vivaria</i>.</p>

<p>Rémy and his successors catch and strip the females of their eggs,
which are pressed out into a pan. They then extrude the milt of the
male on to the eggs, in a proportion, differing according to what fish
are being spawned, of one male to one or more female. They next place
the eggs on perforated wire or other trays fixed in long boxes, over
and under which water of a regulated temperature passes.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>The erroneous view of those of Badham’s school needs correction. By
tracing historically the various and not generally known discoveries
which led to our modern practice of fish-breeding I hope to prove that
the process of the Romans differed from ours. For this reason I subjoin
a short <i>résumé</i> showing why and how Pisciculture as we term it and
know it came about.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

<p>The same demand for fish, the same dearth of fish, which compelled the
enactment in mediæval Europe of stringent laws protecting fish, spawn,
and fry, caused in ancient China and Imperial Rome the breeding of
fish in lakes and <i>vivaria</i> by non-natural methods, and in Europe from
the fourteenth to the nineteenth century the quest of an unnatural or
artificial method.</p>

<p>Laws aimed at repairing the dearth of fish—a very serious economic
matter when all Europe observed frequent fast days—caused by
destruction of spawn and of fish during the breeding seasons by human
and animal agencies, were made in England as early as the reign of our
Ethelred II., who in 996 forbade the sale of any young fish.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>
Malcolm II. of Scotland fixed the times and conditions under which
salmon fishing was permitted. Under Robert I. the willow of the
bow-nets had to be two inches apart, so as to allow a passage for the
grilse. In 1411 Robert III. punished with <i>death</i> anyone taking a
salmon in the close season. The Kings of France were not idle. Many
ordinances fix the meshes of the nets and the length of saleable fish.</p>

<p>The first known attempts at fish-breeding were made by the Chinese and
Romans. M. Haime asserts that “we have no positive data as to the epoch
in which the Chinese began their experiments, although everything shows
that they reach back to the most remote antiquity.” The address of Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
Wei-Ching W. Yen dates the epoch as probably that of Tao Chu Kung, who
lived in the fifth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span><a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a></p>

<p>In Rome considerable trade was done in the sale of young fish for
stocking waters. In China the commerce in fish eggs was on a vast scale
and extremely lucrative. The Jesuit missionary Du Halde writes, “Le
gain va souvent au centuple de la dépense, car le Peuple se nourrit en
partie de Poissons.”<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a></p>

<p>The method, however, of both the Chinese and the Romans was to gather
eggs, <i>already naturally fertilised</i>, lying at the bottom of, or
adhering to weeds in, the water. The Chinese went farther by employing
special traps of hurdles and mats to bar the rivers and catch the eggs
deposited on these.</p>

<p>During the long interval between the Roman Empire and the eighteenth
century, we note little or no progress in the rearing of fish,
although preserves became numerous in Italy and France. Kings and
nobles were zealous and jealous in making and maintaining artificial
ponds. Charlemagne the Great personally ordered the repairing of old
and digging of new ponds. By sales from their <i>vivaria</i>, and by heavy
royalties from their fisheries the religious communities amassed large revenues.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the Middle Ages new methods to counter the scarcity
universally prevalent, despite the teaching in the thirteenth century
of Peter of Vescenza, were eagerly sought. Dom Pinchon, a monk of
the Abbey of Réome, seems the first to have conceived the idea of
artificially fecundating the eggs of trout. He pressed out in turn
the milt of a male and the eggs of a female into water, which he then
agitated with his finger. He placed the resulting eggs in a wooden box,
with a layer of fine sand on the bottom, and a willow grating above and
at the two ends. The box till the moment of hatching was immersed in
water flowing with a gentle stream.</p>

<p>The process—described in a manuscript dated 1420, but not published
till about 1850—naturally led to no practical results. Consequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
Pinchon’s claim to be the father of modern Pisciculture—a term first
used some three hundred years after his death—can hardly be sustained.
His discoveries interest only from a historical point of view.</p>

<p>The middle of the eighteenth century witnessed an improvement on
Pinchon’s plan. In Sweden (where the care taken to protect fish even
prohibited the ringing of bells at the spawning season) the bream,
perch, and mullet attach their eggs either to rocks, or twigs of pine.</p>

<p>Lund shut up males and females for three or four days in three boxes,
furnished with twigs of pine, etc. (on which the fish spawned), and
pierced with little holes to allow the entrance of water. He succeeded
at his first attempt in raising from 50 female bream, 3,100,000 fry;
from 100 perch, 3,215,000 fry; and from 100 mullet, 4,000,000 fry.</p>

<p>Jacobi of Westphalia, the first real inventor of practical fecundation
by artificial means, experimented on trout and salmon for sixteen years
before attaining definite success.</p>

<p>He pressed in turn the eggs and milt into a vase half filled with water
which he kept gently stirred with his hand. The fertilised eggs were at
once placed in a grated box inside a larger chest, in which Jacobi had
inserted at the sides and at the top fine metallic gratings to allow
the easy flow in and out of water over the sand or gravel lying at the
bottom. The apparatus was set in a trench by the side of a brook, or,
better still, in an artificial channel into which springs were led.
The young fish after hatching lived for three or four weeks on their
umbilical sac, and were then passed into a reservoir.</p>

<p>By these simple means Jacobi, who for his services was granted by
England a pension for life, solved the problem of protecting fertilised
eggs against their enemies, and yet of leaving them in surroundings not
unlike those of Nature. The experiment, as far as it went, succeeded admirably.</p>

<p>In Great Britain<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>
Shaw, Andrew, Young, Knox, and Boccius, and in Germany, Blooch, and
others carried on, at various times and with varying methods and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
measures of success. In France little or nothing was done, except
by Quatrefages, till we reach the two peasants, Rémy and Gehin,
whose labours laid firm the foundation on which all subsequent
Pisciculturists have built.</p>

<p>In 1849 the Academy of Sciences learned that a prize had been granted
in 1845 by the Society of the Vosges to two fishermen of La Bresse,
Rémy and Gehin, for having fertilised and artificially hatched eggs
from trout, and for having raised some five to six thousand trout from
one to three years old, which continued to thrive in the waters in
which they were confined.</p>

<p>On investigation by the Academy, it was found that Rémy and Gehin (who
came in later) had been led from conclusions based entirely on their
own observations (for “they are quite unlettered and ignorant of the
progress of the Natural Sciences”) to employ with success methods
rather similar, but superior, to those of Jacobi.</p>

<p>They had enormously decreased the high mortality by their greatest and
probably unique achievement, <i>i.e.</i> provision for the fry of a natural
food. This was produced by the simultaneous rearing of a smaller and
non-cannibal species, and by the collection in the enclosed streams or
made waterways into which the young trout were liberated of hundreds of
frogs, whose spawn afforded an excellent subsistence.</p>

<p>Jacobi’s and Rémy’s discovery was the parent of our modern
Pisciculture. The gear and apparatus, especially in America, have been
transformed. The methods of stripping, of hatching, of feeding are
enormously improved, with mortality in eggs and fry incredibly reduced.</p>

<p>From this account of their discoveries and from the nature of the
methods now in use, it is obvious that the suggestion of Badham
and others that the method of breeding fish employed by modern
Pisciculturists was practically that of the Romans must go by the board.

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class="h_subtitle">THE RING OF HELEN</span></h3></div>

<p>In the countries dealt with in this book I give instances where Fish
and Fishing have, according to myth or tradition, played a prominent
part in human affairs, and have been the cause, direct or indirect, of
important events.</p>

<p>Thus in Greece and Rome, to fish is assigned the responsibility for—</p>

<div class="blockquot1">
<p>(A) The death of Homer, from his inability to solve the riddle of the
lads.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>

<p>(B) The death of Theodoric, who recognised in the head of a pike which
he was eating the head of his murdered victim, Symmachus.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

<p>(C) No less an event than the Trojan War, which, according to the
windbag Ptolemy Hephæstion, happened on this wise.</p>
</div>

<p>In the belly of a huge fish named <i>Pan</i> (from its resemblance to that
god) was found a gem (<i>asterites</i>), which when exposed to the sun shot
forth flames and became a powerful love philtre. Helen, on acquiring
this, had it engraved with a figure of the <i>Pan</i> fish, and when
desirous of making a special impression wore it as a signet ring.</p>

<p>Thus, when Paris visited Sparta the charm blazed from her finger
with the result of the immediate conquest of Paris, the flight from
Menelaus, and the Ten Years’ War!

   <p class="f90">From a Fifth Century <i>Scyphos</i>, made by the potter Hieron and painted

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
But, despite Homer, it was <i>discovered</i> (!) afterwards that Helen was
not in Ilium at any time during the siege, and that what the Trojans
harboured was not her real self, but only her “living image,” εἴδωλον
ἔμπνουν.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>
The discoverer of this interesting fact was (so ran the slander)
Stesichorus. Struck with blindness after writing an attack on Helen, he
recovered his sight by composing a Palinodia.<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>
The ghost of Achilles, when raised by that most famous medium of antiquity,
Apollonius of Tyana, denied positively that Helen was in Ilium.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a></p>

<p>If Mr. J. A. Symonds be right, “We fought for fame and Priam’s wealth,”
and for naught else, then she “with the star-like sorrows of immortal
eyes” was neither <i>causa causans</i> nor any cause of the Fall of Troy.
Perhaps “Priam’s wealth” is but an intelligent anticipation of Mr.
Leaf’s theory that the War was fought for “The Freedom of the Sea”
(Euxine), and, incidentally, the capture of another nation’s profits.

</div>

<p class="f120 space-above2">NOTE</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>Conflicting chronologies prevent the definite dating of the earlier
Egyptian monarchs: verily a thousand years are but as yesterday in
the sight of Manetho, Mariette <i>et cie.</i> Thus it is that the reign
of Menes, the first historical king, has no permanent abiding place
in the 3167 years between 5867 and 2700 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Discrepancy
in dates is not confined to the older or later computators, such as
Champollion-Figeac, Wilkinson, Lepsius, and Petrie, but has infected
quite recent writers, like Borchardt and Albright, who in 1917 and in
1919 respectively place Menes <i>c.</i> 4500, and <i>c.</i> 2900 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>If the authorities disagree as to the dates of the Old, Middle, and
New Kingdoms (the divisions used in my pages), they agree fairly well
on what Dynasties are comprised in each of these. So whether a reader
adhere to 5867 or to 2700 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> for Menes, the Old Kingdom
still comprises Dynasties I. to XI.; the Middle Kingdom Dynasties XII.
to XVI.; the New Kingdom Dynasty XVII. to Alexander the Great or 332

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class="h_subtitle">“THE NILE IS EGYPT”</span></h3></div>

<p>This terse epigram seems foreshadowed by Homer, who calls the river (ὁ)
Αἴγυπτος, and the country (ή) Αἴγυπτος, thus indicating correctly that
Egypt is only the Nile valley.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a></p>

<p>The all importance of the river to the country meets early and general
recognition. In a hymn<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>
it is lauded as “the creator of all things good”: solemn rituals from
the earliest down to Mohammedan times implored “a good Nile”: temples
in its honour existed at Memphis, Heliopolis, and Nilopolis: at
Silsileh ceremonies and sacrifices,<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a>
from time immemorial, welcomed its annual rise; magnificent festivals
were universal throughout the land.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>To Egypt, river or country, goes out the undying reverence of all
Anglers. Whether Egyptian or the Sumerian civilisation were the older;
which of the two have left the earlier signs of a written language<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>;
whether the Egyptian surpassed the Assyrian empire in extent or
magnificence—about all these points “disquisitions” (in Walton’s word)
have not ceased.</p>

<p>But to Egypt belongs the glory of holding in future and happy thrall
world-wide subjects, who salute, or rather should salute (had previous
writers not been reticent on the point) her (and not Assyria) as the
historical mistress and foundress of the art of Angling.</p>

<p>In my Assyrian and Jewish chapters I stress the remarkable absence,
despite the close and long connections of these nations with the land
of the Nile, of anything graven or written which indicates knowledge of
the Rod. In Egypt two instances of Angling are depicted: the first<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>
probably (to judge by his place on the register) by a servant or
fishing-ghillie as early as <i>c.</i> 2000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the second by a
magnate some 600 years later.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<p>The argument of silence—because a thing is not depicted or mentioned
it therefore never existed—often pushes itself unjustifiably. May
not absence of the Rod be an instance? Had Mesopotamia (it may be
further urged) been endowed with the atmospherical dryness of Egypt
and the consequent preservative qualities of its soil instead of a
widely-spread marsh-engendered humidity, would not scenes of Angling
there probably meet our eyes? Humidity may account for great losses in
Mesopotamia, but its toll in the Delta of Egypt was also heavy. This large
area has yielded, compared with the Upper Kingdom, inappreciable returns.</p>

<p>But even if the country of the Two Rivers had possessed the same
climatic conditions as the Upper Kingdom, it could never have become to
the same extent the historical storehouse for posterity of the works
and records of ancient Man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>Difference in religious belief, for one thing, precluded. The
Sumerians, the first settlers recognised by history in the plains
of Shinar, conceived (as did their successors the Babylonians and
Assyrians) the next world to be a forbidding place of darkness and dust
beneath the earth, to which all, both good and bad, descended. Hence
burial under the court of a house or the floor of a room, often without
any tomb or coffin, or much equipment for the life beyond the grave,
was sufficient.</p>

<p>In belief and equipment the Egyptians differed <i>toto orbe</i>. For them
after death was pre-ordained a life to obtain which the body must be
preserved from destruction; otherwise it hastened to dissolution and
second death, <i>i.e.</i> annihilation. To avoid this fate, they resorted to
permanent tombs, embalmment, and mummification.</p>

<p>But as the Double, or <i>Ka</i>, of the departed (unlike the Soul, or <i>Ba</i>,
which fared forth to follow the gods) never quitted the place where
the mummy rested, daily offerings of food and drink for its sustenance
had to be placed in the chapel chamber of the richer tombs. Sooner or
later came the time when for reasons of expense, or other, the dead
of former generations found themselves neglected, and the <i>Ka</i> was
reduced to seeking his food in the refuse of the town. To obviate such
a desecration, and ensure that the offerings consecrated on the day of
burial might for all time preserve their virtue, the mourners hit upon
the idea of drawing and describing them on the walls of the chapel.</p>

<p>Furthermore to make homelike and familiar his new abode, or the
“Eternal House” (in contrast to which the houses of the living were but
wayside inns) elaborate precautions were taken. We find depicted on
the walls of the chapel the lord of the domain, surrounded by sights
and pursuits familiar to him when alive. “The Master in his tomb,”
writes Maspero, “superintends the preliminary operations necessary to
raise the food by which he is to be nourished in the form of funerary
offerings: scenes and implements of sowing, harvesting, hunting,
fishing meet his eye.”</p>

<p>From these representations of actual life, intended for the comfort of
the dead, we, the living, are enabled not only to reconstruct in part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
the manner and social economy of the Ancient Egyptians, but also to
gather, aided by excavated tackle, fairly accurate knowledge of their
various devices for catching fish. And so to the religious conception
which fostered the adornment of the tombs the gratitude of all
fishermen is due, and should be deep.</p>

<p>If the god Hapi, who is represented with the girdle of a fisherman
round his loins, and bearing lotus flowers, fowl, and fish, was hymned
by the people as “the Creator of all things good,” to the Father of
Rivers<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>
the Father of History renders tribute for his gift of one “thing good”
which furnished to all, bar kings and priests, a stable and staple
food, fish.</p>

<p>Its economic importance can hardly be over-rated. Testimony as to its
cheapness and abundance is not wanting. Of such is the wail of the
poorer folk that the price of corn might be that of fish.<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>
Not less impressive rings the plaint of wandering Israel—even
heaven-sent manna apparently palls!—“we remember the fish we did eat in
Egypt for naught.” The Egyptians accounted the fish plague, next to the
death of the firstborn, as direst in result.</p>

<p>Confirmatory witnesses are Diodorus Siculus, who notes the great number
and the many varieties of fish found in the Nile,<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>
and Ælian, who neatly and truly characterises the aftermath of the
annual inundation as “a harvest of fish.”<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>
Evidence, again, of “a plenty” of fish, its pursuit, and its copious
consumption fronts us in the prehistoric kitchen-middens and in the
bone or horn harpoons of pre-dynastic graves. Later, the frequent tomb
fishing-scenes and some textual notices attest absence of dearth.</p>

<p>The numerous slate palettes in the pre-dynastic graves furnish Mr.
Bates with further proof, and with a new theory, which seems to me, if
ingenious, too ingenuous and too far-fetched.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>The palettes,<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a>
almost invariably presenting the profile of only those fishes, birds,
or beasts that historic men pursued for food, were intended (by the aid
of colours extracted from the malachite, galena, etc., crushed upon
them) to establish an unpalpable, but, in human eyes, very serviceable
connection between the fisher and his prey.</p>

<p>One method of such connection consists in creating a likeness of the
intended quarry. Such a likeness, by the belief that the <i>simulacrum</i>
is actively <i>en rapport</i> with that which it represents, bestows on the
possessor power over the original. “Cases,” Bates correctly adds, “of
this sort are the commonplaces of imitative magic.” Usually a hunting
or fishing amulet which simulates the form of the quarry was worn by
the owner, or attached to his gear.</p>

<p>The palettes themselves played the part of mere paint-stones, but
their supposed resident power might very efficaciously be transferred
to its proprietor by means of <i>the paint ground upon it</i>.</p>

<p>“Persons who go in pursuit of the crocodile,” says Pliny, “anoint
themselves with its fat.”<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>
In the same way as the crocodile-hunter thus assimilates himself to his
quarry by a direct contagion, so the owner of the palette could possess
himself of the power in the slate likeness by painting himself with the
“medicine” ground upon it.</p>

<p>The validity, or otherwise, of the suggestion must be determined by
expert mythologists. The theory, to my mind, appears too far-fetched,
and breaks down from the introduction of an additional agency.</p>

<p>The fisher wearing an amulet or attaching a charm to his tackle,
and the fat-anointed crocodile hunter both supposedly have direct
connection with his quest.</p>

<p>But Bates’s solution demands four agents at work, the fisher, the prey,
the portrayed profile of the latter, and the palette; from these the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
fisher extracts the desired power by decorating himself with the
paint made out of a fifth agency, the galena, etc. Here exists no
direct contagion as with the crocodile hunter, or direct connection
as with the amulet-wearing <i>piscator</i>. That such early men as the
pre-dynasties, though possessed of no insignificant a culture, should
reason by causation at a fifth remove, seems lacking in probability,
especially in a matter of primitive semi-religious belief, which is
ever slow, ever resentful of change.</p>

<p>Now let us see by what implements and devices this “plenty of fish” was
made to pay toll.</p>

<p>The documentary evidence on Egyptian fishing is so slight and
fragmentary that were it not for extant implements and representations
of fishing scenes its technical history could not be reconstructed even
partially. The implements carry us back to about the beginning of the
pre-dynastic age, and constitute our principal source of information
regarding Nilotic fishing.</p>

<p>But from the beginning of the Old Kingdom until the Roman period the
material remains dwindle, while the tomb scenes increase in importance.
Later—perhaps in part owing to the changes in the interests of the
Egyptian artist—the implements themselves again become of prime
significance.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a></p>

<p>It is impossible in Egypt, or elsewhere, to allot definite priority to
Spear (or Harpoon), Net, Hook and Line, or Rod. The fact that all four
methods were <i>c.</i> 2000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> in synchronous use
establishes merely a date <i>a quo</i>, a date which indicates (if a first
appearance really prove anything) that Egypt in Angling by over a thousand
years precedes China, where the earliest <i>mention</i> occurs, <i>c.</i> 900
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span><a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>

</div>

<p>The Spear and the Harpoon, with their cousin the Bident, concern
us first. Of the Trident there seems to be neither example or
representation. Priority of use may possibly be conceded to the Spear
in Palæolithic times. The fact that in Egypt we are dealing with an
age, the Copper, separated from the Palæolithic by the New Stone era,
prevents even a guess as to priority on the Nile. Egypt, it is true,
bequeaths us the oldest historical as apart from archæological data,
but these are merely great-great-grandchildren of the <i>débris</i>
data of France, and comparatively modern.</p>

<p>Then again, in Europe the Harpoon was rarely combined with objects of
the Copper Age, in Egypt frequently.</p>

<p><i>The Harpoon</i> has been divided by Bates, but, I think, somewhat
needlessly, into two types.</p>

<p>(1) A spear barbed unilaterally or bilaterally.</p>

<p>(2) A similar Spear which has its head so socketed as to come free from
the shaft when the object has been struck, the quarry being thereafter
retrieved by means of <i>a line made fast to the head itself</i>.</p>

<p>One of the simplest specimens is, perhaps, that figured by Reisner,<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>
while two by Petrie<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>
are, though probably pre-dynastic, of more elaborate workmanship.</p>

To the latter the earliest Harpoons in Egypt appear to be the
three-toothed bone Harpoons of the first prehistoric age. The
representation of launching the Harpoon at fish is one of the commonest
in tombs from the Vth to the XVIIIth Dynasties. The truth seems to
be that the Harpoon as a means of livelihood ceased in the second
prehistoric age, but as an instrument of sport lasted much later,
though in the latest paintings it may be only a religious archaism.<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

<p>Seventy years have failed to displace substantially Wilkinson’s
statements: fish-spearing from bank or papyrus punt was the sportsman’s
method: the spear or bident,<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a>
about nine to twelve feet long, was thrust at passing fish: to it a
long line (held in the left hand) was usually fastened for the purpose
of recovering the weapon and the fish, if struck. Sometimes the weapon
was feathered like an arrow (the author was possibly misled by or is
alluding to the hieroglyph</p>

<p><img src="images/i_p309.jpg" alt=" " width="35" height="101" />, or was just like a common spear.</p>

<p>If the statement be correct that “the <i>bilaterally</i> barbed Harpoon is
almost unknown before the Middle Kingdom times,”<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a>
we are faced by the remarkable fact of a weapon found again and again
in the Magdalenian epoch of Palæolithic Man—each reader can supply his
own conjecture how many millenniums before—being absent in a culture
familiar with Copper Age hooks and harpoons.</p>

<p>But hold what view we may as to the original priority of implement,
<i>examples</i> of Spear-Harpoons are found in Egypt, at any rate, much
earlier than those of either the Net or the Hook.</p>

<p>An illustration or two will serve to confirm the sporting use of the
Harpoon, as advanced by Wilkinson and Petrie.</p>

<p>The first, a fine representation, depicts, in fig. 3, probably
Khenemhetep standing in a papyrus boat in the act of spearing two large fish;
beside him stands an attendant holding a bident Harpoon and a Reel unfixed.

In fig. 4 (an enlargement in colour of the preceding plate) the
<i>barbed</i> heads transfix the heads of two big fish: an attendant holds
a spare harpoon and a reel of cord evidently meant to revolve in its
handle.<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a></p>

<p>In the second<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>
“Senbi, accompanied by his wife Meres, stands in a skiff constructed of
reeds spearing fish. The subject is depicted over and over again in the
tomb-chapels, but here it is imbued with new life. How realistic are
the monster hippopotami who bellow, and display their gleaming white
tusks, as Senbi comes skimming over the water in his frail canoe! The
inscription over Senbi fishing runs as follows: ‘Spearing fish by him
who is honoured by Osiris, Lord of the Western Desert, the Nomarch, the
Superintendent of the Priests, Senbi the Justified.’”</p>

<p>Before passing to the Hook, a few words as to the Reel. Although
Wilkinson would limit its use to Hippopotami, as in Khenemhotep’s
scene, may we not fairly deduce its employment also in the spearing of
large fish?</p>

<p>The surprise sometimes expressed as to the absence of any evidence
that the Reel did duty with the Rod is quite superfluous. The Line of
the Nile, and, indeed, of all Europe till the seventeenth century,
was the <i>tight</i>, not the <i>running</i> Line.<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>
A possibility, but not a probability, of a Reel being used by a man
catching a catfish <i>with line and hook</i> has been detected in Plate 141
of the famous tomb of Ti, which shows the right hand carrying what may
be merely a club, or more likely a stick for the line to be wound on,
when not in use.<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>From the beginning of the Middle Kingdom onward the Reel, of which a
fine example comes from Beni Hasan,<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a>
appears to have found employment against Hippo. From the stick on which
the hanks of cord were wound, perhaps, came its invention.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>
The most developed form shows merely an axle run through holes in
the ends of a semi-circular handle. The ends of the axle were set in
handles, which to some extent facilitated the process of winding
up.<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a></p>

<p>The pursuit of the Hippo originated, like that of the fox in England,
from economic causes, <i>viz.</i> the destruction wrought on crops, not on
flocks and poultry. The beast in pre-dynastic times existed in Lower
Egypt, but by the end of the Old Kingdom seems to have retreated to
Upper Ethiopia. Pliny, however, speaking of its ravages at night on the
fields indicates its survival above Saïs.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a></p>

<p>Diodorus Siculus,<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a>
after surmising that if the Hippo were more prolific things would go
hard with the Egyptian farmer, furnishes the details, but not the
<i>locus</i> of a hunt. “It is hunted by many persons together, each being
armed with iron darts.” With the substitution of copper harpoons for
iron darts, the description applies almost <i>verbatim</i> to some of the
hunting scenes of the Old Kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a></p>

<p><i>The Hook.</i>—At the end of the pre-dynastic or beginning of the First
Dynastic period the Hook, fashioned in no rude method, and wrought of
no primitive material, but of <i>copper</i>, makes its appearance.</p>

<p>From this it is clear that Egypt (<i>a</i>) can lay no claim to have
invented this method, and (<i>b</i>) had travelled many stages on the long
road of piscatorial invention. The complete absence in the Nile Valley
of hooks of bone, flint, or shell which occur in so many neolithic
centres in other parts of the world adds confirmatory evidence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>In Egypt no records of the progenitor of this copper Hook survive. No
family tree helps us, as elsewhere, to surmise whether the thorn, the
flint, or the shell constituted the material of the first hook, for
no non-metallic prototype has come to light. The numerous bone and
ivory points, all more or less like the slender rod or pin of ivory
shown in <i>El Amrah and Abydos</i>,<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>
may, perhaps, indicate the gorges used by fishermen in pre-dynastic
times. The absence, however, in the above example of any indentation in
the middle, round which the line was frequently attached, tends (in my
view) rather to negative the suggestion.</p>

<p>The earliest hooks were of simple shape. The point was barbless. The
head, which in all cases lay in the plane of the hook, was formed by
doubling over the end of the shank against the outside of the latter,
so as to form a stop or an eye, which might, or might not, have been
an open one.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>
Their length (varying from 2 to 6 cms.), if contrasted with the bronze
hooks of the Swiss Lakes, is short in proportion to their width from
the outside of the point to the outside of the shank.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a></p>

<p>The XIIth Dynasty displays a few barbed hooks alongside barbless ones.
One of the latter, belonging to Petrie, excites our interest, for the
string of its attachment (some nine inches in length) is composed of
double stout twist, while another proves itself the ancestor—in fact
itself is—the Limerick hook with a single barb.</p>

<p>By the XVIIIth Dynasty barbed hooks, usually of bronze, largely
predominate. Instead of being headed up in the older fashion they show
the end of the shank expanded, so as to form a small flange in a plane
at right angles to that of the hook. A line bent on the shank below
this flange (even if slight), and drawn hard up against it had the
advantage of chafing less than when made fast to a hook of the earlier
type. The New Kingdom hooks, which continue scarcely altered in Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
times, are well designed, but their barbs are less intelligently placed
than are those of the Middle Kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a></p>

<p>But even in Roman times several types of hook, fairly well distributed
in the Northern Mediterranean, seem unknown in Egypt; for instance,
double hooks, barbed or barbless, of the Bronze Age in Switzerland,
hooks with a split eye or an eye made by twisting the end of the shank
round itself (as found in Crete) and many others are yet to seek.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a></p>

<p>The cluster or gang hook early confronts us in the tomb of
Gem-Ni-Kai.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>
The fisherman here extends his index finger to feel the faintest bite:
below the water the line ends in a cluster of five hooks, one of which
holds a large fish.</p>

<p>The ancient monuments sometimes portray fishing from a boat with
hand-lines. Those of the Old Kingdom as often as not depict the fisher
as an elderly peasant, presumably no longer equal to the brisker
business of hauling a heavy seine.</p>

<p>Occasionally two lines are employed, as in the scene which Blackman<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>
describes: “A small reed skiff, containing two men, one of whom,
lolling at ease in the stern, has just secured a catch upon one of his
lines, while his companion, standing upright in the bow, is pulling his
loaded net out of the water.”</p>

<p>Another instance of hand-lining comes from Beni Hasan.<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a>
The same register contains a representation which is not only the
earliest (<i>c.</i> 2000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) of fishing with a
Rod known in the whole world, but is also (with the exception of that
from the tomb of Kenamūn at Thebes<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a>)
the only depictment, I believe, of the Rod till we reach
Greece about the sixth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>Unless the passion for sport pure and simple dominated rich and poor
alike, we can fairly surmise that Angling yielded good results. The
man in the Beni Hasan illustration, whether a fishing ghillie, or a
professional fisherman belonging to the province which the tomb’s owner
governed, or a peasant fishing on his own, is not merely posing for his picture.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
The Theban illustration (some six hundred years later) squares with
Wilkinson’s statement “sometimes the angler posted himself in a shady
spot by the water’s edge, and, having ordered his servants to spread
a mat upon the ground, sat upon it as he threw his line: some, with
higher ideas of comfort, used a chair, as stout gentlemen now do in
punts upon retired parts of the Thames.” The beat of our <i>piscator</i>,
whose fishing lines should be closely studied, was probably not on “a
retired part” of the Nile, but on one of his own <i>vivaria</i>, which, as
in Assyria and Italy, ensured a supply of fresh fish in hot weather.</p>

<p>The lengths of the Rod and of the Line, if we may compute them by the
height of the Anglers, assimilate fairly well to the eight cubits or
six feet of Ælian’s Macedonian weapon some two millennia later.</p>

<p>Figures of fish caught by the mouth indicate baits, but no data enable
us to identify their nature. Wilkinson’s statement “in all cases
they adopted a ground bait, without any float” leaves itself open
to question. In the Beni Hasan scene of Angling, which he entitles
<i>Fishing with Ground Bait</i>, neither the hieroglyph attached nor
anything else shows that, although in this instance no float appears,
the bait was resting at the bottom, and not moving in the stream. The
tombs generally may have led him to conclude that floats were unknown,
but a netting scene in the Tomb of Ti shows a large float, presumably
indicating the exact spot occupied by the trap in the water.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a></p>

<p>The ancient Egyptian, if he employed the practice of his modern
successor, used scraps of meat, lumps of dough, minnows, and bits of
fish.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a>
In connection with the last two a very curious passage in the Book of
the Dead runs, “I have not caught fish with bait made of fish of their
kind.”<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the plea by the soul of the dead man not to be punished for
what seemingly was a heinous sin. It is hard to discover where the
enormity of the crime arises.<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a>
As most fishes are cannibals, the bait here presents one of their
natural foods. In the case of an <i>artificial</i> bait, which from the
fish’s point of view amounts to cheating and deception, the punishment
presumably fitted the crime, for which no prayer could atone, no pardon
be possible!</p>

<p>Perhaps this conception indirectly caused and still causes the
abstention from such lures as the artificial fly, which the native even
now generally rejects. The implied prohibition, if the whole passage
be not metaphorical, probably sprang from and is a relic of Totemism,
which widely prevailed in early times.</p>

<p><i>The Net</i>: the first <i>examples</i>, owing to their more perishable
materials, naturally post-date those of the Harpoon and the Hook, but
occur in representations far earlier than either. The suggestion that
a part of a Net figures in the hieroglyph of the scenes from the Royal
Tombs at Abydos<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>,
and so denotes its appearance in the 1st Dynasty, carries no conviction.</p>

<p>Close inspection shows the object to be a bag, or piece of cloth.
The Net’s delineation by an artist at the end of the IIIrd or very
beginning of the IVth lies not open to cavil.<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></p>

<p>Peculiar importance pertains to this scene, because it is the
first portrayal of the Net in Egypt, and possibly the very first
<i>representation</i> connected with <i>fishing</i> the whole world over.
It, moreover, as an illustration merely of fish, antedates (if avoiding
the Scylla of Petrie’s and the Charybdis of Albright’s chronologies
we steer by Lepsius’s chart) the famous Sumerian scene of Gilgamesh
carrying fish, by some four centuries.<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>The tomb of Zau furnishes one or two representations of special
interest. Apart from that of Zau himself “dressed in sporting attire”
and spearing fish from a papyrus skiff, the artist in another has let
himself go more freely.</p>

<p>Not content to show what is happening above the surface of the pool,
he breaks through all embarrassing congruities in order to display the
crowded scene below, without which his subject would not have been
completely set forth. The waters extend also to the left, where seven
fishermen haul into a boat a drag-net full of fish, which include, as
in the tomb of Aba, eight different species. Hippopotami and crocodiles
do not fail to appear: even the humble frog, who sits among the water
reeds, is remembered.<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a></p>

<p>Netting obtained more widely than its depictments, in proportion to
those of Harpooning and Angling, indicate. Representations of the
latter methods occur nearly always in the durable tomb-chapels of the
rich, who from their ampler leisure more often ensued sport, while the
professional fisherman, like his Greek and Roman brother, came of the
tribe whose badge was poverty. Then, too, it must be remembered that
the Netsmen mainly inhabited the Delta, which from reasons of humidity
has yielded fewer pictures of life.</p>

<p>Practically every kind of Net known to the ancient world found
employment in Lower Egypt, as the list drawn up by Julius Pollux, by
birth himself a Deltan, makes clear. The representations give us many
Nets. The hand, the double-hand, the cast (most rarely), the stake,
the seine, etc., all find place. Weights of stone, but none of lead
(according to Bates), meet our eyes in the monuments.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>

<p>Netting needles range from pre-dynastic to Roman times. The first, of a
very simple type, are merely flat pieces of bone, pointed at each end,
and pierced in the middle.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>
Net-making and Net-mending scenes are not absent. In one of the latter
the artist, of naturalistic turn, shows an old fisherman mending a
hand-net, and gripping the end with his toes, while a lad, preparing
twine, rubs his spindle on his thigh.<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>Actual specimens of Net twine prepared from flaxen and other vegetable
fibres were discovered at Kahun in balls of two-strand and of
three-strand string of the XIIth Dynasty. Fragments of Nets “having ½
to ¾ inch (1·2 to 1·9 cm.) mesh, the smallest being ⅛ inch (say 0·3
cm.) square,” came to hand at the same locality.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a></p>

<p>Kahun yielded also some fragments of later, probably XVIIIth Dynasty,
Nets, with meshes from 0·5 to 1·5 cm. and made of coarser twine than
the earlier examples,<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a>
whose fineness of mesh tallies with the small size of some of the
ancient needles.</p>

<p>Weels or wicker fisher traps (especially in the Old Kingdom) come
down to us either small (about 1 m. 50 long), simply constructed, and
capable of manipulation by two men, or very large, of more complex
fashioning internally, and requiring several men to handle.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a></p>

<p class="space-below2">Whether the Egyptians employed poisons, like
most of the Mediterranean nations, I have not discovered. As examples,
they are impossible of survival; for depictment of their actual use not
even the boldest Nilotic Cubist would have been adequate, unless he
imitated the Athenian artist by hieroglyphing “These be poisons”!</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XXV<br /><span class="h_subtitle">ABSTENTION FROM FISH</span></h3></div>

<p>The statement, “the Nile contains all sorts and kinds of fish,”<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a>
must in an age of scientific enumeration be taken with several grains
of salt. The total for the whole country, riverine and marsh, reaches
but seventy-one species, of which only two, <i>Mormurops anguillaris</i>
and <i>Haplochilus schælleri</i>, are peculiar to
Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>
A score or so find representation in ancient times; but identification
is far from easy, and is in some cases, <i>e.g.</i> the Mullets, only
possible generically.</p>

<p>In scenes of the return of Hatshepsut’s expedition from the land of
Punt the drawings of the fishes are so characteristic that Prof.
Doenitz has been enabled to determine their species, and identify
them as belonging to the Red Sea. The powers of observation in the
artists accompanying the ships demonstrate careful training. But I
cannot, since the eyes of the <i>Solea</i> are similar, endorse the eulogism
bestowed in the case of a sole, unless it were a freak, “one eye is
drawn larger than the other, showing a fine observation of Nature!”<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a></p>

<p>The priests, the King, and the commonalty in some cases eschewed fish.</p>

<p>Priestly abstention was by no means uncommon, as some of the temples of
Poseidon<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>
demonstrate. In Egypt the observance was strict, at Askalon the reverse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
Plutarch,<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a>
confirming and amplifying Herodotus,<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>
writes:—“The priests indeed entirely abstain from all sorts: therefore
on the ninth day of the first month (<i>Thoth</i>), when all the rest of
the Egyptians are obliged by their religion to eat a fried fish before
the doors of their houses, they only burn them, not tasting them at
all, assigning as their reasons two, the second of which—indeed, the
most manifest and obvious—is that fish is neither a dainty, nor even a
necessary kind of food.”<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></p>

<p>But by the priests of Atargatis, to whose subjects ichthyophagia
was under pain of blains, boils, and other dire diseases absolutely
forbidden, fish boiled and roasted were daily offered, and by them
daily eaten.<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a></p>

<p>The religious ceremony in Thoth may have been merely a later aspect
of a taboo once possibly universal among the class from which the
priesthood largely drew, or may, perhaps, have been prompted by the
desire of obtaining a good fish harvest. Apart from the uneconomic
depletion of food entailed by the prescribed eating, the killing of
“the children” or possessions of the deity seems hardly the best way to
secure fruition of such desire.</p>

<p>If, however, the feast survived as a relic of Totemism, the ceremony
may possibly come within Robertson-Smith’s conception of the origin
of all religious communion or sacraments, <i>i.e.</i> a renewal of the
connection between the god of the Totem tribe with his people at a
meal, where “the Totem itself is sacrificed at an annual feast, with
special and solemn ritual.”<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></p>

<p>In the same way, eating of fish by the priests at Askalon may have
originated from the idea of bringing the deity and his servants into
closer relationship, and may have been continued to impress their
religious superiority on the mass of the people, who were forbidden
such food, and thus any direct connection with their god. Although the
practice was different, the object of both priesthoods—enhancement of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
their religious prestige—was identical. Where the people abstained,
they ate; where the people ate, they abstained.</p>

<p>The Kings as High Priests seem, down to Ptolemaic times, to have
eschewed fish absolutely. The <i>Stele</i> of Piankhi, at any rate,
indicates their practice <i>c.</i> 700 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> To this Nubian
conqueror of Egypt came the petty Kings of the Delta to offer
submission; but “they, whose legs from fear were as the legs of women,
entered not into the King’s house, because they were unclean and eaters
of fish, which is an abomination for the Court: but King Namlot, he
entered, because he was pure, and ate not fish.”<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a></p>

<p>The reason for this insistence by a Nubian lay perhaps in the fact that
Piankhi had as monarch of Egypt just been affiliated to the Sun-god,
who not only created righteousness, but lived and fed upon it. A
curious prayer or semi-threat by one of the dead survives. If he be not
allowed to face his enemy in the great council of the gods, the Sun-god
should or would come down from Heaven and live on fish in the Nile,
while Hapi, the god of the river, should or would ascend to Heaven and
feed on righteousness. The granting of his prayer or the fulfilment of
his threat would reverse the whole scheme of creation.<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a></p>

<p>The word translated by <i>abomination</i> signifies generally <i>something
dirty</i>. The epithet, if the Deltaic kings resembled the Deltaic
fishermen, is not inappropriate. Many representations of the XVIIIth
and XIXth Dynasties render the latter, in contradistinction to their
brothers of the river proper, with scrubby beards, uncouth of aspect
and scant of dress—a characteristic which Diodorus Siculus notes, when
describing their habitations as mere cabins of reeds.</p>

<p>But in fairness it must be remembered that since nearly all history and
representations reach us from Upper Egypt, these portraits may merely
typify the contempt or dislike felt by the richer and more civilised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
Nilotic for his Deltaic brethren,<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a>
in whom some writers profess to discern an indigenous and less
progressive race.</p>

<p>Were the records and art of Buto, for example, a capital once ranking
in importance and opulence with Thebes, available, another story and
another picture might confront us. Owing in the main to humidity, our
conceptions are perforce coloured by the traditions of Upper Egypt, and
thus at times liable to deception.</p>

<p>Is it, for instance, likely that the priests and denizens of the
Delta, where maritime commerce principally furnished their prosperity,
regarded the sea with the same loathing and dread that the riverine
priests and writers express? Can we really imagine the priests of
Alexandria not eating salt because it was “Typho’s foam,” or not
speaking to pilots because they do business on the great waters, or
embellishing their temples with figures (like those at Saïs) of an
infant, an old man, a hawk, a fish, and a sea-horse?</p>

<p>The meaning of these figures, according to Plutarch,<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>
“is plainly this: O! ye who are coming into or going out of the world,
God hateth impudence, for by the hawk is intended God, by the fish
hatred on account of the sea, as has been before observed, and by the
sea-horse impudence, the creature being said first to slay his sire,
and then force his mother.”</p>

<p>How and when did the abstention from fish arise? Was it originally a
<i>tabu</i> observed by all, kings, priests, nobles, and commons?<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>
Did the last come gradually to disregard or were they forced by food
pressure to rebel against it? Did the nobles in the Old and Middle
Kingdoms occasionally wobble in their diet? All these questions meet
with no adequate answer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>An answer to the first, <i>i.e.</i> the date and reason of the abstention,
as yet baffles even the richness of the fertile preservative sands of
Egypt, since adequate data must stretch back to pre-dynastic periods.</p>

<p>One fact stands out. The lower classes very early eschewed the <i>tabu</i>
and ensued after fish. Their example was followed later by the upper
classes, “with whom fish became a favourite dish: the epicure knew
each variety, and in which water the most dainty were to be caught. It
was, therefore, a most foolish invention of later Egyptian theology
to declare that fish were unclean to the orthodox, and so much to be
avoided that a true believer might have no fellowship with those that
did.”<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></p>

<p>Robertson-Smith declares that the doctrine—the highest degree of
holiness can only be attained by abstinence—resulted from the
political fusion in Egypt of numerous local cults in one national
religion, with a national priesthood that represented imperial ideas.<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a></p>

<p>The statement, “countless pictures of offerings to the gods and
the dead survive, but never a fish among them” has in the light of
subsequent discoveries to be revised. One strong reason at any rate
existed in its favour. In the Pyramid texts carved on the sepulchral
chambers of the Pharaohs of the VIth Dynasty the hieroglyph of the fish
was deliberately suppressed, which goes far to prove that fish were
regarded as impure for kings. Furthermore, in the thousands of lines
which contain spells for the future benefit of these dead Kings not one
figure of a fish occurs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, evidence exists of practices in apparent conflict
with the above facts. Newberry,<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a>
provides two Middle Kingdom instances of fish being brought to the owner of the tomb,
and Maspero<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a>
one of the New Kingdom.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, again, how about the famous representations of fish, both upon
an altar and also on the face of an altar, in Capart’s work?<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a>
These basalt statues (he holds) exhibit the King making offerings of
fish; others regard them merely as the King marching at the head of the
Nile gods, and himself representing the great river, “the giver of all
things good.”</p>

<p>Donations of fish were frequently made to the temples by the Kings.
Rameses III., for instance (as the Harris Papyrus discloses) presented
thousands and thousands, labelled “dressed, cut up, and from the
canal.”<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>
These gifts were not for the priests, but (probably) for their
employés or the populace.</p>

<p>We read (in the Hammamat <i>Stele</i>) of “the officers of the Court
Fishermen” attendant on Rameses IV. Their task, unlike that of a
similar corps in the Chinese court whose duty (<i>inter alia</i>) was to
manage the arrangements for the Emperor’s sport, principally consisted
in securing “a plenty of fish” for the enormous entourage and servants
of the monarch.</p>

<p>But the Pharaohs till Cleopatra were, as far as I can gather,
personally as free from the sin of fishery, as the net offered to the
Syrian goddess in the epigram of Heliodorus.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>

<p>The problem as to fish being offered or not to the gods or the dead
may possibly be solved, if we bear in mind that while fish are never
mentioned in the longer versions of the offering texts of the Old
Kingdoms, and are not represented in the pictures of the food provided
for the dead before the XIIth Dynasty, after that date some occasional
instances to the contrary do occur.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>Figures (even of food, as I have shown) drawn in the tombs were
supposed to retain their original powers. To avoid their contact with
the dead by walking into his chamber, figures of human beings, of
animals including snakes, of birds, but not of insects, were, at any
rate in the VIth and XIIth Dynasties, frequently mutilated.<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a></p>

<p>A prayer<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>
shows how real was the fear: “Let not decay caused by any
reptile make an end of me, and let them not come against me in their
various forms.” The danger to the royal Ka from a fish swimming, or
from the fish <i>Clarias macracanthus</i> walking from its habitat in the
Upper Nile into the tomb chapel, beggars description!</p>

<p>The apparent anomaly, that while scenes of fishing occur in the tombs
as often as those of fowling and hunting, and that while the latter
frequently, the former never, figure in the offerings, is (according to
Lacau<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a>)
quite easy of explanation. When a man dies, he is identified with
and taken to Osiris, to whom, like the other gods, no fish was meet
for offerings, whereas the <i>scenes</i>, which depicted them, were
representations of what a man had done or known in his lifetime.</p>

<p>Additional doubts whether the ban against fish-offerings met with
exceptions, are caused by the discovery of models of fish buried in
the XIXth Dynasty foundation-deposits along with those of fowl, beef,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>
Perhaps the <i>modelling</i> differentiates the instance. If fish
were neither meet nor permissible offerings to the gods, how came it
that some deities were venerated in connection with fish?</p>

<p>The evidence of Strabo that the <i>Lates niloticus</i> was at Latopolis,<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a>
a city named in the fish’s honour, revered in conjunction with
a goddess whom he terms Athena, may, like that of many another
globe-trotter, perhaps, be discounted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>But when we find in the scattered stones of that temple various sorts
of fish, one enclosed in a royal cartouche<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>
and at the same place a Ptolemaic-Roman cemetery, containing great
numbers of <i>Lates</i>, mummified by art or
Nature,<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a>
and when further we find at Gurob, near the old Moeris Canal,
cemeteries of the same fish unassociated with human remains, and dating
from the XVIIIth or XIXth Dynasty, when we find all
these,<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> we are driven, as was the negro when faced with
another, but logical, dilemma, to “purtend brains, at any rate scrat heads.”</p>

<p>Nor is our “purtending or scratting” ended, when attempts, based on the
finding in the fish cemetery at Gurob of a small head of a goddess, are
made to connect the Athena of Strabo with Hathor, to whom Keller<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>
alleges that the <i>Oxyrhynchus</i> (often found embalmed at Thebes) was
sacred. So, again, our clarity of ideas is not increased, when we read
that Hat-mehyt was the patron goddess of Mendes, the capital of the XVI
Nome (which of all the Nomes alone possessed a fish for its emblem) and
that this fish is regularly represented above the head of Hat-mehyt.</p>

<p>But one fact stands out as adverse to the identification of any god as
a god of fish or connected with fishing. In the magico-religious welter
of god-creating and god-adopting characteristic of the later Egyptians,
who locally worshipped beasts, birds, reptiles, and insects, the first
commandment given to Israel was faithfully observed, in that they
made not unto themselves a graven or other image of any deity “of the
likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth.”<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a></p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XXVI<br /><span class="h_subtitle">SACRED FISH</span></h3></div>

<p>Apart from the mythological fishes, the <i>Abdu</i> and the <i>Ant</i>, which
were supposed to accompany the boat of the Sun, we find others held
sacred or worshipped in different Nomes or cities.</p>

<p>Before considering these, I draw attention to the cut of a
representation from Gamhud,<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>
and to the account by E. Mahler of a <i>Stele</i>, attributed to Thotmes III.,
now in the Museum at Buda-Pesth.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a></p>

<p>Both are remarkable; for in both <i>Fish</i> takes the place of the usual
Bird-Soul. As the Buda-Pesth <i>Stele</i> is unpublished, we have to depend
on Mahler’s account. He tells us that in the ancient beliefs and myths
of Egypt the fish was a symbol of eternity, and guided the boat which
bore the dead to the waters of the blessed.</p>

<p>The Gamhud illustration, attributed to the Ptolemies, who held fast to
the tradition that the parts of Osiris were eaten by three fishes, one
of which was the <i>Oxyrhynchus</i>, has a distinct interest, because here
for the first time the <i>Oxyrhynchus</i> figures as a substitute for the
Bird-Soul.</p>

<p>The Buda-Pesth <i>Stele</i> probably deduces from Gurob, where there is, or
rather twenty years ago was, a fish cemetery excavated by Petrie. Here,
too, was a temple built by Thotmes III., and a smaller one erected in
his honour.</p>

<p>The idea of the dead man may well have been “I have embalmed thousands
and thousands of fish. Now then, one of you, in return do your best to
secure for me immortality.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a>
states that only two fishes are venerated, the <i>Lepidotus</i>
and the <i>Phagrus</i>. The Father of History is not open in this case
to the charge of exaggeration, for with these the <i>Oxyrhynchus</i>,
and (according to Strabo) the <i>Lates niloticus</i>, and (according to
Wilkinson) the <i>Mœotes</i> should be included.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

   <p class="f90">From Ahmed Bey Kamal, <i>Annales du Service des Antiquités de l’Égypte</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Various reasons are assigned for the veneration, local if not
national, of these particular fishes. Wilkinson suggests, with a
touch of ironical humour—“the reason of their sanctity (<i>i.e.</i> the
<i>Oxyrhynchus</i> and <i>Phagrus</i>) was owing to their being unwholesome: the
best way of preventing their being eaten was to assign them a place
among the sacred animals of the country!”</p>

<p>Some writers detect in their sanctity a remnant of local Totemism, a
word which in blessedness equals and in length of inadequate definition
surpasses Mesopotamia.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>But Robinson, disagreeing with Robertson Smith and Frazer in their
conception of Totemism, denies that these fish were totems in any
proper sense. Primitive man performs an act of positive sacrifice when
he devotes to the religious tribal idea the best fish of the waters,
and thenceforth abstains from eating them; whereas the Egyptians
shabbily denied themselves only the refuse. They made that sacred which
they could not eat. All the evidence tends to the suspicion that the
gods were put off by the priests with the very worst of the fish. If a
species were poisonous or belonged to a class that was unwholesome, it
was straightway declared sacred.<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a></p>

<p>Speaking from my own experience and purely on palatal grounds, had I
been High Priest I should have banned nearly all Nile fishes for their
insipidity and muddiness. Tastes, of course, differ. The <i>Lates</i> is
passable, but the <i>Oxyrhynchus</i> attracts no opsophagist devotees, which
is probably the fault of “The Creator of all things good” in either
the temperature of his water or the character of their food, since a
cousin, <i>O. mormyrus</i>, geographically not far removed, is ranked by
epicures as delicious.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a></p>

<p>The reason assigned by the priests to Plutarch for the abstention from
and local veneration of the <i>Oxyrhynchus</i>, <i>Phagrus</i>, and <i>Lepidotus</i>
possesses, whatever its truth, the charm of an antiquity reaching back
to the dawn of goddom.</p>

<p>After the slaying of Osiris by Typho, Isis made unwearied search for
his body. But she could never recover his private part, for it had
been flung into the Nile, and eaten by the <i>Lepidotus</i>, the <i>Phagrus</i>,
and the <i>Oxyrhynchus</i>: “fish which of all others, for this reason, the
Egyptians have in more especial avoidance. But Isis made its effigies,
and so consecrated the <i>phallos</i>, for which the Egyptians to this day
observe a festival.”<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a></p>

<p>The same author vouches for the veneration of the <i>Oxyrhynchus</i>, as
shown by the people of the city named after that fish; “they will not
touch any kind of fish that have been taken with an angle, for they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
afraid lest perhaps the hook may be defiled by having at some time or
other been employed in catching their favourite fish.”<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>
Ælian goes farther: “were but one of these fish taken in a net, the townsmen would
let the whole catch free.”<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a></p>

<p>Holy Wars, even if unpreached by a tarbushed Kaiser, came to pass in
Plutarch’s day; “within our memory, because the people of Kynopolis
presumed to eat their fish, the Oxyrhyncites<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a>
in revenge seized on all the dogs, or sacred animals of their enemies
that came in their way, offering them in sacrifice, and eating their
flesh in like manner as they did that of their other victims: this drew
on a war between the two cities, wherein both sides, after doing each
other much mischief, were at last severely punished by the
Romans.”<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a></p>

<p>To another religious war, between the Ombites and the Tentyrites, we
owe the great Satire XV. of Juvenal, when banished to Egypt at the age
of eighty.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>
The poem ranks high, not only for its mordant irony but also for its
description of the origin of civil society, “a description infinitely
superior to anything that Lucretius or Horace has delivered on the
subject,” according to the not always laudatory Gifford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
The <i>Phagrus</i> had the distinction of being venerated in Egypt and
Greece, whose writers, bothered by none of our scientific hesitation,
regarded him not as one of the Mormyri, but as the Eel. They scoffed
alike at his deification and his devotees.<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Phagrus</i>, and the <i>Mœotes</i>, which is Wilkinson’s addition to the
four other sacred fish, were probably the same under different names.
Ælian, indeed, states that the former, worshipped at Syene, was called
the <i>Mœotes</i> by the people of Elephantine (quite close to Syene), and
attributes its sanctity to its annual appearance always heralding the
rise of the Nile,<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a>
a property of prescience transferred by Plutarch to the
<i>Mœotes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a></p>

<p>We know so little about the <i>locus</i> of the <i>Lepidotus</i> (<i>Barbus bynni</i>)
cult that Wilkinson’s assertion, “its worship extended over most parts
of Egypt,” needs confirmatory data.</p>

<p>The Crocodile, like the <i>Lates</i>, was worshipped here and there, but
elsewhere keenly hunted. Of the first Thebes and Lake Mœris furnish
types. Each place (according to Herodotus) harboured one crocodile
in particular, very tame and tractable.<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>
They adorned his ears, as Antonina her <i>Muræna</i>, “with earrings of
molten stone or gold, and put bracelets on his forepaws, giving him
daily a set portion of bread, with a certain number of victims: when he
dies, they embalm and bury him in a sacred place.”<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a></p>

<p>Of the various methods for catching the crocodile our author sets forth
one which we all must agree as “worthy of mention.” “They bait a hook
with a chine of pork, and let the meat be carried out into the middle
of the stream, while the hunter on the bank holds a living pig which
he belabours. The crocodile hears its cries and making for the sound
encounters the pork, which he instantly swallows down. The men on the
shore haul and, when they have got him to land, the first thing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
hunter does is to plaster his eyes with mud. This once accomplished,
the animal is despatched with ease, otherwise” (it may surprise you)
“he gives great trouble.”<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></p>

<p>Both the <i>Phagrus</i> and the Crocodile possessed foreknowledge as to the
rise of the river, the first as to time, the latter as to extent, for
“in what place soever the female lays her eggs, that may be concluded
to be the utmost extent to which the Nile will spread that year.”<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a></p>

<p>Blackman<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a>
praises the art of a scene, as (although the crocodile
is but roughly blocked out) one ranking with the finest specimens of
ancient Egyptian bas-reliefs: “not even the Old Kingdom mastabas at
Sakhara can produce anything to surpass it for vigour and beauty of
technique.”<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a></p>

God. In truth there is no calling which is not better than it.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a></p>

<p>The classification of Egyptian society made by Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a>
merits mention if only on account of its unexpected gradations; (A)
Priests, (B) Warriors, (C) Cowherds, (D) Swineherds, (E) Tradesmen,
(F) Interpreters, (G) Boatmen. The position allotted to the cowherd
and swineherd before the tradesman, if startling to modern eyes,
characterises most early societies. “For trader,” as Seymour shows,
“Homer knows no word.”<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a>
<i>Fishermen</i>, although unnamed but presumably included under boatmen,
figure last, a rank consonant with that assigned by the Scribe above.</p>

<p>If their life was socially of the lowest and their toil of the hardest,
they must have earned a modest living, even though no tacksman
millionaire finds record. We may fairly assume a general and constant
demand for fish from (A) the revenues yielded by fisheries, and (B) the
taxes paid by fishermen.</p>

<p>Of (A) Lake Mœris affords a striking instance. When the water retired
from the lake to the Nile, the daily sale realised one talent of silver
(reckoned by Wilkinson at £193 15<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>), and when the current set
the other way one-third of that sum, but in all some £45,000 yearly.<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a>
We learn that the proceeds of these fisheries formed the dowries or
allowances for the scents, etc.,<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>
of the Queens.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>Later on they also received as appanage the revenues of Anthylla famous
for its wines, so they fared not badly for pin money. Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a>
informs us that the town “is assigned expressly to the wife of the
ruler of Egypt to keep her in shoes. Such has been the custom ever
since Egypt fell under Persian rule,” an origin not improbable from
Plato’s statement that one district was allotted for toilette purposes
to the Persian Queens and called “The Queen’s Girdle.”</p>

<p>(B) The taxes (or revenues) obtained in the Ptolemaic times, ἰχθυηρά,
were probably a Government monopoly. They were divided into (<i>a</i>) a tax
on fishermen of one quarter of the value of the fish caught (τετάρτη
ἁλιέων), (<i>b</i>) the profits of sale of fish at prices higher than those
paid for them direct to the fisherman.</p>

<p>In the Roman period we find τέλος ἰχθυηρᾶς δρυμῶν, or a rent from
marshes deep enough at the time of the inundation to contain fish and
shallow enough at other times to grow papyri and marsh plants. Leases
for fishing and selling papyri, etc., brought good returns. But these
returns must be distinguished from other revenues derived from the
industry, <i>e.g.</i> the fisheries of Lake Mœris, and from a tax paid by
the fishermen, both of which seem to correspond with the Ptolemaic
“fourth part.” On the other hand the φόρος, no doubt, was a tax paid by
fishermen for the right of fishing, or for the use of boats in waters
owned by the temples.<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a></p>

<p>The Net, in the marsh country, was not only the most lucrative “engine
of encirclement,” but also a double duty paid. In other parts the
inhabitants passed their nights upon lofty towers to escape the gnats,
but in the marsh land (Herodotus continues), “where are no towers, each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
man possesses a net instead.<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>
By day it serves to catch fish, while at night he spreads it over the
bed in which he is to rest and creeping in goes to sleep underneath.”
While struck by the resemblance to Goldsmith’s article of furniture,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A bed by night, a chest of drawers by day,”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>we are forced once more to “scrat head,” and very hard. Imagination
reels before the mesh of a Net, capable alike of catching a marketable
fish and denying a gnat!</p>

<p>Fish intended for immediate use were usually dressed on the boat and
quickly dispatched to market; the rest of the catch was opened ashore,
split, salted, and hung to dry in the sun. Pictures<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a>
of all these operations, and examples of splitting knives, survive.
Splitting in the earlier eras, for some reason, ran, not sheer down the
back, but always rather to one side or other.</p>

<p>Promptness of curing in a hot climate like Egypt was all important.
Diodorus, indeed, tells us that practically all fish were at once
pickled or salted, a statement confirmed by Julius Pollux’s mention of
the Egyptian <i>tariché</i>, especially that from Canopus, being exported<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a>
far and wide, certainly to Palestine, whither “the Egyptian fish came
in baskets or barrels.”<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a></p>

<p>Prices of wheat, honey, fish and other wares occur in Spiegelberg’s
work,<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>
but no attempt is made by him (as far as I know) to correlate
the prices in ancient and modern Egypt.</p>

<p>I essay the task more as a <i>jeu d’esprit</i> than for any result of
economic value, by means of the <i>Mugil capito</i>. This grey mullet has
been identified with the ancient <i>’Ad</i>, a fish which figures frequently
in the representations, <i>e.g.</i> in the Tomb of Ti, of Ptahhetep,<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a>
and of Naqada.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a>
Its habit of ascending the Nile from the sea was known
and noted by ancient authorities. Strabo, after stating that it, the
Dolphin, and the Shad were the only fish so to do, informs us that the
Mullet in his upward journey carefully consorted with the Schalls,
or Catfish, whose strong spikes afforded it protection against the
crocodiles.<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>We find at the end of the XXth Dynasty, say 1200 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, that
300 of <i>Ireth</i> fish, 100 of <i>Shena’</i>, and 800 <i>’Ad</i> (each lot) fetched
1 <i>kite</i> of silver—the <i>kite</i> being <small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub></small>
of a <i>deben</i> of 91 <i>grammes</i>. Although in the XVIIIth Dynasty gold had
been just twice as valuable as silver, at this time silver stood to
gold in a ratio of 1⅔ to 1.</p>

<p>Thus 100 <i>Shena’</i>, 300 <i>Ireth</i> (both of which are as yet unidentified)
and 800 <i>’Ad</i> fish were (each lot) worth <small><sup>91</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub></small>&nbsp;×&nbsp;⅗, <i>i.e.</i> 5·46
<i>grammes</i> of gold.</p>

<p>Now one sovereign weighs 123·27447 grains, and as <small><sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub></small>
of this is gold it contains 113·0016 grains of gold. As a <i>gramme</i> equals 15·432
grains, the value of 5·46 <i>grammes</i> of gold thus works out at about 14
shillings and 11 pence to the nearest farthing. The whole calculation,
however, depends on the assumption that the <i>kite</i> is known to be
exactly 9·1 <i>grammes</i>.</p>

<p>This, the latest estimate of its probable weight, can only be an
estimate, for the Egyptians of the XVIIIth Dynasty, at any rate, did
not make weights to a minute fraction of a <i>gramme</i>. A calculation
therefore to the nearest farthing is somewhat meaningless, unless the
weight of the <i>kite</i> is determined to be 9·10, and not 9·09 or 9·11
<i>grammes</i>. Since the weight is certainly not known to two places of
decimals, it is doubtful if it can be regarded as correct to the first
place. Hence 14<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> is not absolutely a more accurate estimate
than 15/-.<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a></p>

<p>Assuming for convenience that the <i>kite</i> was worth 15/-, we could have
purchased at the end of the XXth Dynasty 800 <i>’Ad</i> fish for this sum.
One fish would thus cost <small><sup>(15 × 12)</sup>&frasl;<sub>800</sub></small>
= <small><sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>40</sub></small> of a penny: but since the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
Egyptian <i>Mugil capito</i>, as sold in the big markets, averages (I am
informed) ½ lb., the conclusion of the whole matter is that in the era
mentioned 1 lb., or two fish, cost <small><sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub></small>,
or ·45 of a penny. In pre-war days the average marketable price worked
out at 2·954 pence per lb., so the Egyptian <i>Mugil</i> in 1913 cost about
6½ times more than <i>c.</i> 1200 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, while the
English <i>Mugil</i> in 1913, which (according to figures kindly furnished
me by the Fishmongers Company) averaged 10 to 12 pence per lb., cost
about 24 times more.</p>

<p>The Egyptian correlation of 6½ to 1 cannot, it is true, be definitely
established until we have data proving that the <i>kite</i> was exactly 9·1
<i>grammes</i>, nor can it be accurately applied to other commodities, but
it may help us to a rough approximation of what some of their prices
were in the XXth Dynasty.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<p>The depreciation of money between the XVIIIth and XXth Dynasties,
heavy as it seems, was as nothing to that which ensued in subsequent
centuries. Examples of this can be observed in the fall of the
Gallienus <i>tetradrachm</i> from about half a crown to one halfpenny
in less than a century. Again under Macrianus (260 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>)
the coinage was so bad and so worthless that the banks closed their
doors, but were compelled by the king to open and continue “his divine
coinage.” At the time of Diocletian’s Edict on maximum prices (301
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) a <i>denarius</i> (4 <i>drachmæ</i>) was reckoned
at <small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>50000</sub></small> of a
<i>litra</i> of gold, but in Egypt after Constantine’s reign it fell much
lower, <i>e.g.</i> 432,000 <i>denarii</i> equalled 1 pound.</p>

<p>From the <i>Papyrus Oxyrh.</i> 1223 we find the <i>solidus</i> computed at
2,020 × 10,000 = 20,200,000, (!) <i>denarii</i> at the end of the fourth
century.<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a></p>

<p>Billon <i>Denarii</i>, <i>i.e.</i> made out of copper and very little silver,
ceased to be coined at Alexandria after <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 297, and got
utterly depreciated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>We get little farther in our quest of correlation of prices even with
other passages; in <i>Pap. Fayum Towns</i> (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 100), of 12
<i>drachmæ</i> for fish; in <i>Pap. Petrie III.</i> 107 (<i>e</i>), 6, 24 <i>drachmæ</i>
for fish (third century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>); and in a Papyrus not yet (1918)
published, 4 <i>obols</i> and 5 <i>obols</i> for a “male” <i>Cestreus</i>, or <i>Mugil
capito</i>.</p>

<p>With salt fish, again, we have no certain leading. For 2 <i>dipla</i> or
double jars of this comestible the price was 2 <i>drachmæ</i>, but then
their size is uncertain.<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a>
So again it doth not vantage us much to read of 240 <i>drachmæ</i> being
given in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 255 for “a jar of pickled
fish” (λεπτίον), because the size of the jar is still
undetermined.<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a>
Nor does “56 <i>drachmæ</i> for 100 pieces of salt fish” (third century
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) solve the problem because, although a
“piece of salt fish” probably implied some definite weight, we have
no data for discovering to what this amounted.<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>
Nor again can we deduce anything definite from the statement that in
the third century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> a jar (κεράμιου) of
salt fish fetched 1 <i>drachma</i> 1½ <i>obols</i>.</p>

<p>The superior derision with which some writers regard the simple, if
inaccurate account, given by Herodotus of the spawning of the Egyptian
fish betokens their ignorance of the parable of the beam and the mote.</p>

<p>If Herodotus erred, what (and this I keep reiterating, on the Kipling
principle of “lest we forget”) about the theorists for 2300 years as to
the procreation of Eels?</p>

<p>Aristotle with his “Entrails of the earth,” Oppian with his “Slime
of their bodies,” Helmont with his “May Dew,” others with their
“Horse-hair,” and Walton with his “Spontaneous Generation” are they
as correct zoologists as the Father of History? With him procreation
resulted from a semi-direct if inaccurate connection, but May Dews and
Horse-hairs, etc., etc., what do they or what could they do in the
galley of contact?</p>

<p>After which outburst I pass to Herodotus.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a></p>

<p>“Gregarious fish are not found in any numbers in the rivers; they
frequent the lagunes, whence, at the season of breeding, they proceed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
shoals towards the sea. The males lead the way, and drop their milt as
they go, while the females, following close behind, eagerly swallow it
down. From this they conceive, and when, after passing some time in the
sea, they begin to be in spawn, the whole shoal sets off on its return
to its ancient haunts. Now, however, it is no longer the males, but
the females, which take the lead: they swim in front in a body, and do
exactly as the males did before, dropping little by little their grains
of spawn as they go, while the males in their rear devour the grains,
each one of which is a fish. A portion of the spawn escapes and is not
swallowed by the males, and hence come the fishes which grow afterwards
to maturity....</p>

<p>“When the Nile begins to rise, the hollows in the land and the marshy
spots near the river are flooded before any other places by the
percolation of the water through the river-banks; and these, almost as
soon as they become pools, are found to be full of numbers of little
fishes. I think that I understand how it is this comes to pass. On the
subsidence of the Nile the year before, though the fish retired with
the retreating waters, they had first deposited their spawn in the mud
upon the banks: and so, when at the usual season the water returns,
small fry are rapidly engendered out of the spawn of the preceding
year. So much concerning the fish.”</p>

<p>And was the great zoologist Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a>
more accurate in his suggestion as to spawning? “Some surmise that
the female becomes impregnated by swallowing the seminal fluid of the
male. And there can be no doubt that this proceeding on the part of
the female is often witnessed, for at the breeding season the female
follows the males and perform the act and strike the males with their
mouths under the belly, and the males are thereby induced to part with
the sperm sooner and more plentifully.”</p>

<p>The Pahlavi texts tell us that at spawning time or season of excitement
fish in pairs travel to and fro a mile in running water. In this coming
and going they rub their bodies together, and a kind of sweat drops out
between, and both become pregnant.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /><span class="h_subtitle">FISHING WITH THE HAIR OF THE DEAD</span></h3></div>

<p>This chapter owes its birth to a passage of intrinsic interest but
gruesome nature.</p>

<p>Before quoting or dealing with it, I may be allowed a few words as to
my running it to ground and the curiosity it excited among Angling
scholars.</p>

<p>Some years ago I read in an article that “fishing with the hair of a
dead person, ἔδησεν νεκρᾷ τριχὶ δέλεαρ, was practised by the Egyptians,
as is shown by discoveries during the last thirty years.” No authority,
no reference was given. “Thirty years” opened up a search too extensive
to waste on an anonymous statement.</p>

<p>Even so this fishing with an unknown gut, dead men’s hair, kept
worrying me. Aristotle and others had written of the use of horse-hair,
but none of my friends or I had ever come across this Egyptian tackle.
A great authority suggested that it was possibly taken from a body of
which the hair continued to grow after death, and thus possessed much
value because of length and strength.</p>

<p>Instantly floated before us visions of obtaining by a new <i>Rape of the
Lock</i> this most desirable gut. Two nefarious courses were discussed.
First, to rifle the coffin of Edward I., which when last opened in Dean
Stanley’s time revealed (<i>teste</i> the Verger) long hair still growing.
Second, to raid the tomb of the Countess of Abergavenny (<i>née</i> Isabella
Despencer) in Tewkesbury Abbey, in which (to use Canon Ernest Smith’s
words) “at the restoration of the Abbey in 1875 was disclosed bright
auburn hair, apparently as fresh and as plentiful, as when the body was
buried four and a half centuries ago.”<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>

<p>Do the Sagas or other ancient Scandinavian literature, in which
descriptions of fishing frequently figure, allude to such use of dead
men’s hair? Two of the foremost Scandinavian scholars could recall
none. <i>The Kalevala</i>—the great Finnish epic—yielded no help.</p>

<p>Nearest comes the account of “Gunnar’s Slaying” in <i>Story of the Burnt
Njal</i>.<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a>
After his bowstring has been cut by his foe, Gunnar said unto
his wife, Hallgerda, ‘Give me two locks of thy hair, and ye two, my
mother and thou, twist them together into a bowstring for me.’ ‘Does
aught lie on it?’ she says. ‘My life lies on it,’ he said; ‘for they
will never come to close quarters with me, if I can keep them off with
my bow.’ ‘Well,’ she says. ‘Now will I call to thy mind that slap in
the face thou gavest me,’ and refused him her hair.</p>

<p>Gunnar, just ere he falls, sings:</p>

<p>I subjoin a translation:—</p>

<p>“And so hastening over the rugged ground he came unto the unsightly
shores, and there seated on a rock tied the rod with dead hair, and
taking bait and feeding with little morsels, drew the hook along (or
up and down) in the deep pool. But as naught was caught,” and as αὕτη
μὲν ἡ μηρινθός οὔδεν ἔσπασεν,<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a>
both in its literal and proverbial sense held true, he returned to the
place whence he came, the place of corpses.</p>

<p>The Editors’ introduction to the Papyrus runs: “The matter of the poem
is hardly less remarkable than the manner in which it was written down.
The subject is the adventures of a man whose name is not given. After
some talk, the hero proceeds to a place which is full of corpses being
devoured by dogs. He then makes his way to the sea-coast and proceeds
to sit down on a rock, and fish with Rod and Line. He did not, however,
succeed in catching anything: we then revert to the corpses, the
gruesome picture of which is further elaborated. The language and style
of the composition, the literary qualities of which are poor enough,
clearly show its late date, not posterior to the second century.”</p>

<p>I am indebted to Professor Grenfell for further information. “The
Papyrus,” he writes me, “is certainly a poem describing the descent
of some one to the under-world.” An Austrian, A. Swoboda,<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a>
wrote an article to show that it belonged to a Naassene<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a>
psalm describing the descent of Christ to Hades. The beginning of a
poem on this subject, in the same metre as the Papyrus, is known from
Hippolytus, <i>Refutatio Hereticorum</i>. The second column of the Papyrus
seems to be an address to a Deity, and would fit in with Swoboda’s theory.</p>

<p>“The composition being, in any case of a mystical and imaginative
character, I do not think the description of the fishing incident is to
be regarded as in any way real, and, from the fisher’s point of view,
it is not to be taken literally. <i>No parallel for the use of dead men’s
hair in fishing has ever been suggested.</i> In none of the Papyri are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
there any details about the modes of Angling. Ἔδησεν, which I should
translate <i>tied</i>, has been generally supposed to refer to the angler’s
line, and considering the composition is poetical, this seems the
natural interpretation.”</p>

<p>This coupled with the Introduction to the Papyrus appears to shatter
the statement that fishing with the hair of a dead person was practised
in ancient Egypt. But although in such a mystic adventure as a Descent
to Hades all is possible and all is pardonable, the passage can hardly
from its extremely abrupt and casual mention of hair be regarded as
heralding in the use of this substance as a quite new adjunct to
fishing. It partakes of the nature of a simile.</p>

<p>If it be true that an ancient simile was intended to throw light from
the more familiar on the less familiar, but never to illustrate the
moderately familiar by the wholly strange, one might, despite the
absence of all reference to such tackle in the representations or in
classical writers, possibly argue that lines made of the hair of the
dead were known and were used by the Egyptians. The substitution of the
hair of a dead person for the hair of a horse may be but a bold and not
ineffective attempt to heighten the mysticism of the picture.</p>

<p>Apart from the pleasant gain which the quest and the running down of
this hare in “a mare’s nest” (to mix metaphors boldly) entailed, one’s
only real satisfaction is that the Egyptian angler, notwithstanding his
gruesome gut and loathsome bait, caught <span class="smcap">Nothing</span>!</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XXIX<br /><span class="h_subtitle">THE RING OF POLYCRATES</span></h3></div>

<p>In accordance with my custom of ending the <i>Fishing</i> of each nation by
a story in which fish play directly or indirectly an important part,
I searched for an Egyptian tale or legend. The serpent Apep in the Ra
myth is merely a variant of similar beasts figuring in the Bel and
Andromeda legends: his story, moreover, lacks the stir of battle of the
former, or the human interest of the latter.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> The absence of any such
legend is due doubtless to the bad esteem in which fish were held by
the priests, who in the early days, at any rate, wrote the history of
the country.</p>

<p>As Maspero in his <i>Contes Populaires de l’ancienne Égypte</i> (which
by the by differs in <i>The Two Brothers</i> from the account given by
Plutarch) failed to provide provender, I perforce fall back on a story,
which, if Ægean in <i>locale</i>, is Egyptian in effect, the tale of the
ring of Polycrates.</p>

<p>This has been used by Cicero and other ancient writers to point the
moral of calling no man happy until his death, and by modern to adorn
many a tale of good luck, but since its historical importance has
often been neglected, I venture to recall shortly what Herodotus sets
forth.<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>Polycrates, Tyrant of Samos, was so proverbial for a good fortune,
which had never met with check or disaster, that Amasis, King of
Egypt, fearing the effects of the φθόνος of the Gods on Polycrates and
consequently on their newly-formed alliance, advised him to propitiate
them by getting rid of one of his most valued possessions. Accordingly
the Tyrant cast into the sea<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a>
his seal-ring of extraordinary beauty, which in a few days was found in
the belly of a fish and restored to him.</p>

<p>This last shock of happy fortune was too much for Amasis, who broke
off his alliance and thus left Polycrates free to aid Cambyses in his
invasion and conquest of Egypt. It is fair to add, even at the expense
of this pretty fish story, that Grote (IV. 323) holds that Polycrates
himself broke off the Egyptian to effect the more powerful Persian alliance.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX<br /><span class="h_subtitle">NO ROD, ALTHOUGH CLOSE INTERCOURSE WITH EGYPT</span></h3>
</div>

<p>There is no delineation or suggestion of the Rod, or of Angling on any
sculpture or any seal, Sumerian, Babylonian, or Assyrian.<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a></p>

<p>The omission does not preclude the existence or use of the Rod. If
it did exist, and were used, we are surprised that there should not
survive amongst the thousands of things mentioned and the many pursuits
represented a single indication of it. Our wonder, indeed, grows
stronger when we call to mind that the Assyrians:</p>

<div class="blockquot1">
<p>(<i>a</i>) Were a people much given to sport of all kinds:</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Were keenly addicted to the eating of fish, which was not,
as in Israel or Egypt, half-banned by a prophet, or whole-barred to a
priesthood by custom, totemistic or other:</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Did attach very real importance to the maintenance of an
ample supply of fish. Their dams and <i>vivaria</i>, the adjuncts of
every important temple or every self-respecting township, and their
enforcement of Fish Regulations, attest the economic value:</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Do mention and do represent other kinds of fishing, <i>e.g.</i>
with the hand-line and the net. The latter, for both fowling and fishing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
often finds place in their, and Israelitish, metaphors. Examples occur
in the story of the defeat of Marduk and Tiāmat, “They (the enemies)
were cast into the net,” and in the prayer of Eannatum to the god Enki
that, if the citizens of Umma in future break the recent treaty, he
will destroy them in his net. But in the legend of the taking of Zu,
the stealer of the destiny-tablets, the net of the Sun-god is certainly
a fowling one:</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Did possess near at hand, and had not to import (as the Romans
from Africa) ample material for the Rod in reeds, which were abundant
near Babylon and were utilised in the construction of furniture,
light boats, and fences. In the lists of private property these
reeds—employed for household not angling purposes—figure not
infrequently:</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Were for hundreds of years closely associated in intercourse
and trade with the Egyptians, whose use of the Rod can be carried
back to about the XIIth Dynasty, <i>c.</i> 2000, or, according to Petrie’s
chronology, <i>c.</i> 3500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Before discussing the date of the first contact or connection between
the two countries, it is advisable shortly to distinguish between
the three peoples whom I group under the term Assyrians, and roughly
apportion the periods of the four thousand odd years of Assyrian
history during which each was predominant.</p>

<p>The first, the Sumerians, occupied before—perhaps long before—the
close of the fourth millennium the land on the lower plain of the
Tigris and Euphrates and on the sea coast, as it then was.<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a>
They possessed an advanced civilisation, with an organised government, many
large cities, and considerable agricultural and industrial development.</p>

<p>Whence their emigration, to what family, Mongol or other, they belong,
is not clear. It is settled they were <i>not</i> Semites, like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
Babylonians and Assyrians. Their language (preserved in liturgies,
etc.,<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>
down even to the time of the Persian conquest) and their writing,
adopted by the Babylonians and Assyrians, which runs, unlike the
Hebrew, from left to right,<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a>
disprove Sumerian descent from Shem.</p>

<p>It is impossible at present to fix a definite period for their
immigration. The dates assigned vary from 7000 to 4000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
The statement, however, that “Aryans, Turanians, Semites were all
in a nomadic condition, when the early Sumerian settlers in Lower
Babylonia betook themselves to agriculture, builded great cities, and
established a stable government,” seems hardly exaggerated, even though
it postulates a very ancient era.</p>

<p>The second, the Semitic Babylonians, starting possibly from South
Arabia by way of the Syrian coast, reached the lower part of the Tigris
and Euphrates about 3800 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span><a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a>
It was not, however, until some thousand years afterwards, that they
effected a conquest of the Sumerians.</p>

<p>Like other defeated peoples, such as the Canaanites with the Jews, the
Irish with the English, “Hibernis ipsis Hiberniores,” they grafted
their policy on that of their victors, and perpetuated many of their
racial characteristics and customs, as well as their religion. “The
Semitic invaders seem to have been completely converted. In fact
Babylonian religion has scarcely anything characteristically Semitic in
it.”<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a></p>

<p>The third, the Assyrians proper, an offshoot from Babylonia, are found
(before 2300 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) pushing their way north along the Tigris,
on whose western bank they founded their first city and earliest
capital—Asur. Wars between them and Babylonia mark the history of
centuries. Their definite suzerainty over that country was only
established by Tiglath-Pileser III., <i>c.</i> 730 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing now to the dates of the connection between this Empire and
Egypt, the first assigned is:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Early dynastic, say about 4400 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
which would probably correspond to the early Sumerian periods. Some authorities
indeed hold that Egypt was invaded by Babylonians, or was culturally
permeated by the “proto-Babylonians,” or Sumerians. Of invasion we
possess no proof, or even strong suggestion; of cultural permeation,
to which Hommel, in especial, attributes the whole primeval culture
of Egypt, some elements and some signs are possibly noticeable, but
even these are Semitic, not Sumerian,<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a>
while their total compares insignificantly with those of native
origin.<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a></p>

<p>Of these signs, the use by the Egyptians of the cylinder seal, of which
the Royal tombs of the first Dynasty afford examples, stands out as the
most important. As this characterised Sumer and Babylonia at all times,
while it fell into disuse in the country of the Pharaohs, the seal was
inferred to be an original product of Sumer, whence it reached Egypt in
late pre-dynastic or early dynastic times.</p>

<p>But (as King<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>
continues) “Recent research—such as Naville’s at Abydos, and Reisner’s
at Naga-ed-Dêr—leaves small room for the theory that early Egyptian
culture was subjected to any strong foreign influence in early dynastic
times; thus the theory of the invasion by Semitic tribes must be given
up.” Maspero maintains that as far back as the IVth or Vth Dynasties
there were overland relations between Egypt and Chaldea.<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Petrie<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> places the beginning of the invasion of Egypt by the
Semites about 3400 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> When referring to a painting of one of
these Princes of the Desert named Absha coming into Egypt, he writes
that “though 1000 years before Abram” (whom he himself dates about 2100
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) “he was one of the same race: it is therefore invaluable
as an historical type of the great Semitic invasion.” Evidence from
Egyptian sources seems to show that before and after the conquest by
the Hyksos, Semitic invasions occurred after the VIth Dynasty and again
<i>c.</i> 2250 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>Petrie, on the strength of the cylinder of Khendy and the tablet of
Khenzerm—two Babylonians “who rose to the throne of Egypt”—concludes
that an invasion from Syro-Mesopotamia took place in the XIVth Dynasty,
say 2800 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) It is not, however, till the XVIIIth Dynasty, <i>c.</i> 1400
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, that we reach firm ground for fixing the first
point of <i>direct</i> historical contact between Babylonia and Egypt.</p>

<p>Authority for this dating is found in the famous tablets brought to
light in 1887 at Tel-el-Amarna, which include letters from the rulers
of Babylonia and Assyria to Amenhotep III. and his son Akhenaton. Apart
from the historical value of their presumptive indication of an earlier
intercourse, the discovery discloses three points of great interest.</p>

<p>First, the fact that these were written in Babylonian shows that this
language had already become the <i>lingua franca</i> of the civilised world.
Second, a more human personal note, the probability from the red dots
(still visible) made by some Egyptian with a reed for the purpose of
marking the divisions of the foreign words, that the acquisition of
this <i>lingua franca</i> was advisable, perhaps necessary, to qualification
for a clerkship or an embassy. Third, that Babylonian <i>literature</i> had
found its way among the nations which used its language.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>

<p>Of this we have conclusive evidence in two documents. The first
concerns the goddess Ereshkigal, the other transmits the legend of
Adapa.<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a></p>

<p>From the Bekten <i>stele</i> we deduce a close intercourse between the two
countries about the XIXth Dynasty, for we read of Rameses II.<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>
being in Mesopotamia “according to his wont, year by year,” and receiving
tributes and presents from the chiefs of the countries round about.</p>

<p>The connection between Assyria (proper) and Egypt rests on ample
evidence. Fish, or “beasts of the sea,” passed as presents, perhaps as
trade. On the Broken Column of Tiglath-Pileser I. (Cylinder IV. 29-30)
we read, “And a great beast of the River, a great beast of the Sea, the
king of Musrê” (probably Egypt) “sent (unto him).”</p>

<p>The <i>Select Papyri</i> (pl. 75, 1, 7) tell of certain fish being brought,
perhaps as a staple of trade, from the Puharuta or Euphrates to Egypt,
and (in pl. 96, 1, 7) of another fish or fishy substance called <i>Rura</i>,
being imported from the land of the great waters, Mesopotamia.<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a></p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XXXI<br /><span class="h_subtitle">FISHING METHODS</span></h3></div>

<p>The relevance to fish and fishing of all the preceding matter, except
the last two sentences, may be challenged: a moment’s consideration,
however, shows that it is apposite.</p>

<p>The object of introducing these historical facts is to demonstrate (1)
the existence of an intercourse between Assyria and Egypt for certainly
fourteen hundred, possibly three thousand, years, (2) to show cause
for our astonishment at the absence of the Rod from all Mesopotamian
representation or records, and at the non-adoption of a weapon which
for centuries found favour with the Egyptians.</p>

<p>In my Jewish chapter I comment at length on the absence of any mention
of or allusion to the Rod in Israelitish literature and on the
unconvincing reasons advanced for this absence. Angling may have been
unsuited to the Semitic temperament, because it yielded less lucrative
returns than the Net.</p>

<p>Even if we grant that the ruling or only passion of this temperament
was for fishing “in plenty,” why, we are driven to ask, did both
nations condescend to fishing with hand-lines, which are not much more
productive than the Rod? If hand-lining was prompted by some instinct
of sport, why was Angling, the higher development of this instinct, not
also reached?</p>

<p>Of the four implements of Fishing, the Spear, the Rod, the Line and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
Hook, and the Net, the Assyrians seem to have been acquainted only with
the last two, Line and Hook, and Net.</p>

<p>Examples of the former method occur in <i>Monuments of Nineveh</i> (1st
Series). In Plate 39B, a man sitting on a terrace by a river is
depicted in the act of landing a fish; in Plate 67B, a man is wading
in a river with what seems to be identical with a creel. The first
was excavated, and subsequently re-buried at Nimroud, the latter
(also re-buried) at Kouyunjik. The second picture excites a livelier
interest, for two men well into their fish are shown in the water
astride the inflated skins of a goat—a method of crossing the Tigris
as habitual then as in the present year of our century.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a></p>

<p>Despite Rawlinson’s sentence, “of early Chaldean (<i>i.e.</i> Sumerian)
there are found made of bronze materials chains, nails, and
fish-hooks,”<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>
no specimen of a fish-hook, bronze or other, has been as yet obtained
in Mesopotamia. It is impossible thus to determine whether the hooks
were straight like those recorded by Plutarch, bent like those of the
Odyssey, or barbed. Cros, however, claims that Lagash excavations
yielded “copper fish hooks.” <i>Rev. d’Assyr.</i>, vi. 48.</p>

<p>Representations also fail to help, probably because a hook, plain and
simple, hardly commends itself as a subject for artistic treatment.
Nor does the primitive Assyrian sculptor, however distrustful of the
imagination of the observer, go as far as to depict “by conventional
device” a hook inside the mouth of the fish which is being taken!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Assyrian language there is apparently no word for fish-hook.
From the resemblance between the Hebrew word <i>ḥōaḥ</i>, which means
both thorn and fish-hook, and the Assyrian word <i>ḥâḥu</i>, which, it is
alleged, means thorn, it has been conjectured that in the latter word
we have the Assyrian term for fish-hook. Professor S. Langdon, who in
a letter to me advances this conjecture, goes even farther—“in fact
<i>ḥâḥu</i> is our only direct evidence for the practice of fishing with
hook and line in Assyria.”</p>

<p>Basing himself on a similar Hebraic resemblance, he would make the
Assyrian <i>ṣinnitān</i>, “two reins,” come from a supposed <i>ṣinnitu</i>, a
possible feminine of <i>ṣinnu</i>, which occurs perhaps in the sense of
“thorn,” and carry the same meaning as the Hebrew <i>ṣên</i>, which probably
equals “thorn,” while its plural <i>ṣinnōth</i> does stand for “fish-hooks.”</p>

<p>He believes that in the word, <i>abarshu</i>, which Esarhaddon employs, “I
snatched him (Abdi-Milkuti, King of Sidon) as a fish from the sea,”
and again, of a chief of the Lebanon range who had rebelled and fled,
“I caught him from the mountains like a bird,” we have evidence of a
technical word for pulling or jerking out a fish with a line held in
the hand, or perhaps attached to a Rod, because “snatch” would hardly
be the appropriate term for the slower action involved in the drawing
in of a net.<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a></p>

<p>Whether in the first simile the suggestion is philologically valid is
a point for Assyrian scholars to determine. The adequate rendering
or explaining of Sumerian words by Assyrian ones is often difficult
and doubtful, for while the latter language is a great help to
understanding the former, the Assyrian, especially the later Assyrian,
equivalent does not entirely correspond to what would be expected from
a literal analysis of the Sumerian word. The second simile, I hold,
alludes to the Net of the fowler, with which the representations show
the Assyrians to have been familiar.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>While there may be doubt whether we possess any Assyrian word
signifying hooks, there can be none as to their existence and their
employment.</p>

<p>From the absence of any, even conjectural, word for or representation
of a float, we can only infer that ground bait fishing was the chief,
perhaps the sole, line method in vogue.</p>

<p>I can find no evidence that the Assyrians availed themselves of the
spear, the trident, drugs or poison, but as the first two figure in
Egyptian, Jewish, and Roman records, and appear to be the common
property of all early peoples, the probability is that they were known
and used in the Two Rivers.</p>

<p>The fish of these resembled the fish of the Nile in their alleged
refusal to rise to a fly, but our soldiers have caught on the fly
hundreds of “salmon” of good weight up to 112 lbs. One (hand-lined)
scaled 170 lbs., and one (speared) ran up to 215 lbs. This “salmon” is
a kind of mahseer, the noblest of the carp family,<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a>
or, according to Mr. Tate Regan, a barbel, probably the species <i>Barbus esocinus</i>
described by Heckel as coming from the Tigris.<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a></p>

<p>The second method was by Netting, which to judge from its repeated
occurrence either as a pursuit or in metaphor was universal, and
prevailed far more extensively than line fishing, especially in
Sumeria. The only Sumerian word, according to Dr. Langdon, for
fishing, <i>ha-dib</i> (one of the oldest words in the world for the act or
occupation), signifies or is akin to a word signifying “to surround,”
<i>i.e.</i> with a net, as does the Babylonian term <i>bâru</i>. If this be
the case, Netting probably constituted their universal, possibly their only
fishing.</p>

<p class="space-below2">In the eastern division of Assyria proper lie
the main tributaries of the Tigris, such as the Zāb and the Diyālā,
rising among the Kurdish mountains. As Netting was naturally more
restricted in this area than in the Persian Gulf, line fishing possibly
obtained more widely here than in the South.</p>

   <p class="f90">From L. Heuzey, <i>Restitution matérielle de la stèle des Vautours</i>, Pl. 1, Fragment E.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
At any rate it is from the Sumerian excavations that we derive a
well-known example of metaphorical Net fishing. This is to be found
in what till lately has been held to be a fine representation<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a>
of Ningirsu, the god of the Sumerian Telloh or Babylonian Lagash,
triumphing over his enemies.</p>

<p>The Net full of prisoners symbolises the capture of the enemies of the
city. To indicate the impossibility of escape (Jastrow continues), “a
prisoner who has thrust his head out of one of the meshes is being
beaten back by a weapon in the hands of the god.”<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a>
King further elaborates the scene; “The god grasps in his right hand a
heavy mace which he lets fall upon the Net in front of him containing
captives, whose bodies may be seen writhing and struggling like fish in
the broad meshes. On the relief, the cords of the Net are symmetrically
arranged: the rounded corners at the top show it as a Net formed of
ropes and cordage.”<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a>
But later Sumerian scholars deny that Ningirsu has anything to do with
the Net or even figures in the scene. On the <i>Stèle des Vautours</i> the
person represented is not a god, but a king, Eannatum, with captured
soldiers enclosed in the Net (<i>Shusgal</i>). What is more, the king in the
accompanying inscription, not only designates the Net as that of Enlil,
the earth god, but also of Ninharsag, the mother goddess, of Enki, the
water god, of Siu, the moon god, and of Shamash, the sun god. All the
greater gods were supposed to carry nets: Ningirsu must certainly have
possessed one, but neither he or it are depicted here.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XXXII<br /><span class="h_subtitle">THE EARLIEST RECORDED CONTRACT OF FISHING</span></h3></div>

<p>One of the very earliest—the earliest as far as I have found—recorded
contract concerning fishing occurs in the second year of Darius II.,
422 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> It runs thus<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a>:—</p>

<p class="blockquot2">“<span class="smcap">Ribat son of Bel-Eriba
the slave of Enlil-nadin-shumi spoke of his own free will to
Enlil-nadin-shumi son of Murashu in the following manner: ‘The fishpond
between the village Ahshanu and the farm of Bel-abu-uzur in the field
of the master of the merchants and the fishpond in the field of the
Prefect and the fishpond by the village of Bit-Natun-El, give me for
yearly payment. Each year I will give one half talent of pure silver,
and from the day on which the fishponds are given to me for fishing,
daily will I supply fish for thy table.’ And then Enlil-nadin-shumi
heard him, and he gave him fishponds for a yearly tribute of half a
talent of silver.</span></p>

<p class="blockquot2"><span class="smcap">Signed in the presence of two
judges, before six witnesses, and a scribe.</span>”</p>

<p>The next recorded fishing contract deals with netting in Babylonian
waters. It is dated the 25th day of Elul in the fifth year of Darius
II., or 419 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> B. Meissner’s translation of the document may
be rendered as follows<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>:—

<p class="blockquot2"> “<span class="smcap">Makimni-anni the son of
Bel-ab-usur, Bi’-iliya the son of ... &amp; Ishiya, Natin the son of
Tabshalam, and Zadabyama the son of Khinni-Bel, of their own free
will spoke as follows to Ribat, the son of Bel-eriba, the servant of
Rimut-Ninurta: ‘Give five nets and we will deliver to you five hundred
fish of good quality (tuḳḳunu) by the 15th day of the month Tishri in
the 5th year!’ Then Ribat hearkened unto them and gave them five
nets.<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a>
On the 15th of Tisri they shall deliver the five hundred fish of good
quality. If they do not deliver the five hundred fish of good quality
on the appointed day for their delivery, then on the 20th day of Tishri
shall they deliver a thousand fish. Each one goes bail for the other in
respect of making up the number of the fish. For the five hundred fish,
Bel-ibni, the son of Apla, also goes bail.</span>”</p>

<p>The parties to the contract are Ribat, the steward of the rich
Babylonian banker Rimut-Ninurta, and five Aramaic fishermen. In
consideration of Ribat’s furnishing five nets, they bind themselves to
deliver by the 15th of Tishri (about September), <i>i.e.</i> within twenty
days from the making of the contract, five hundred fish. On failure to
do so, the time is extended by five days, but the number of the fish
is then increased to one thousand. Each of the five fishermen “goes
bail” for delivery of five hundred, or if need be, of a thousand fish,
but an outsider, Bel-ibni, son of Apla, cautiously limits his bail or
guarantee to the first figure.</p>

<p>These documents possess many points of interest.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>(A) They are not only the very earliest, but I suggest the only extant
<i>fishing</i> contracts (proper) prior to the third century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
In Egypt, during the Ptolemaic period, fishermen, it is true, had to
pay to the Government a quarter of the value of their catch (τεττάρτη
ἁλιέων), but this seems to have been a regular tax. Later on we
find fishermen paying to the priests of Lake Moeris a φόρος (not to
be confounded with ἰχθυηρὰ δρυμῶν, or state tax) which presumably
included the purchase of the right to fish, as well as the hire
of boats. But this was in the nature of a royalty or rent, was a
continuous obligation, and proportioned to the catch, whereas in
our second document the time is limited, and the payment fixed, not
proportioned.<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a></p>

<p>(B) The second contract demonstrates that the custom of additional
guarantors is no mere modern institution.</p>

<p>(C) It also tends to show that the system, previously known as employed
by Babylonian landlords, of letting their farms to tenants for a fixed
proportion of the crops, extended occasionally to their waters as well.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XXXIII<br /><span class="h_subtitle">FISH-GODS—DAGON</span></h3></div>

<p>I find no trace in Assyria of Ichthyolatry, or of certain fish being
accounted sacred, or forbidden as food. The nearest approach to
abstention occurs in the warning that on the 9th day of Iyyar to
partake of fish was almost certain to bring on an attack of sickness,
just as in Syria ichthyophagy was held to entail ulcers and wasting
diseases.<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a></p>

<p>Despite the Dagon or Oannes traditions, I am not convinced that in the
crowded pantheon of Babylon or Assyria there can be found a fish-god
proper, or god of fishing, <i>i.e.</i> a deity similar to those of Greece
and Rome with a temple and established priesthood, to whom fishermen
made prayer and offerings either for boons received or favours to come.</p>

<p>If the word, fish-god, is limited strictly to those images, half-man,
half-fish, which are to be found on seal Cylinders,<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a>
or sculptured or depicted in the outer halls or walls of some
deity’s temple, there is certainly—even if the images at
Nineveh were importations from the Mediterranean coast and not
indigenous—considerable proof of their existence. But if the word
connotes the attributes of a special temple, a priesthood, and
sacrifices, such as we find in connection with the Philistinian Dagon
at Ashdod, I suggest there is no proof whatever. The fact seems to be
that in early Sumeria the fish-god or man-fish was a <i>symbol</i> of Ea,
the god of water, and probably derived from Aquarius.<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p>The Assyrian colonists carried north with them the pantheon of the
Babylonians, composed in part of the local deities of Sumeria, and in
part of their own translated from their original habitat; but from the
start they modified the hierarchy and changed materially the individual
attributes of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a></p>

<p>Thus we find that mighty Assyrian hunter, Tiglath-Pileser I., in his
record of the beasts he had taken, <i>e.g.</i> four elephants caught alive,
or had slain in the desert, which included “four wild oxen mighty and
terrible, ten elephants, one hundred and twenty lions on foot, and
eight hundred speared from his chariot,” ascribing his success to the
help of the gods Ninurta and Nergal.</p>

<p>These gods were closely associated with battle and sport, but to both
other characteristics were attributed at various epochs of their
godhood. It has been suggested that the evolution of the fish-god
Dagon from the Babylonian deity Dagān followed on such lines, but
sufficient data for an identification of the two do not survive.</p>

<p>From the sculptures discovered at Kouyunjik and at Nimroud (now in the

Layard is able, although all three vary somewhat in details, to
describe this so-called fish-god, be it Oannes or Dagon,<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>
as “combining the human shape with that of the fish. The head of the
fish formed a mitre above that of the man, whilst its scaly limbs,
back, and fan-like tail fell as a cloak behind, leaving the human limbs
and feet exposed.” But in identifying this mythic form with Oannes, he
terms it merely “the sacred man-fish,”not deity.<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a>

<p>There were to be seen in the temple of Belus, according to Berosus,
sculptured representations of men with two wings, or two faces, with
the legs and horns of goats,<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>

with the heads of dogs.<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a></p>

<p>I venture to suggest that the mystic fish-form of Dagon or Oannes is of
the same nature and in the same category as the man with the legs and
horns of goats, or with the hoofs of horses: but these mythic goat or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
horse forms were not elevated into goat-gods or horse-gods. The idea
of the deification of the fish-forms, whether that of a man issuing
from a fish or of a man whose upper half was human but lower piscine,
may, perhaps, have sprung from the undoubted worship by the Philistines
at Ashdod and elsewhere of the god called Dagon, and partly to the
original description of him in the A.V., but now corrected in the R.V.</p>

<p>Dagon, it will be remembered (I Samuel v. 4), after being confronted
with the ark of the Lord in the morning, was found fallen: “the head of
Dagon and both the palms of his hands lay cut upon the threshold, only
the fishy part (A.V.) or stump (R.V.) of Dagon was left unto him.” From
this passage Milton undoubtedly drew his conception of—</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>It is possible that the theory of his having from his navel down the
form of a fish, and from his navel up the form of a man—a theory which
is unknown to the <i>Targum</i>, Josephus, or the <i>Talmud</i>, and perhaps is
as late as the twelfth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span><a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a>
—merely transfers by the help of etymology the description given by
Lucian of the goddess Derceto, worshipped on the same coast-line by the
Syrians, who were more partial to fish deities than the
Assyrians.<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a></p>

<p>This Dagon has been mistakenly connected with Odacon, the last of the
five sea-monsters who arose from the Erythræan Sea. His body (according
to Berosus) was like that of a fish, but under the head of the fish was
that of a man, to whose tail were added women’s feet, whose voice was
human, and whose language was articulate. During the day he instructed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
the Sumerians in letters and in all arts and sciences, more especially
in the building of temples, but at night he plunged again into the
sea.<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a></p>

<p>Authorities disagree whether Dagon derives his name from the
Hebrew <i>Dāg</i>, signifying fish, or <i>dāgān</i>, sheaf or agriculture.
Sanchouniathon early held, as do most modern writers, the latter view.
Reichardt errs in his conjecture that the representation in De Sarzec
(p. 189) shows the deity holding in his hand ears of corn, instead of
what really is a palm branch of the conventional type.<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a></p>

from their laps, or from vases in their laps, and containing fish, and

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XXXIV<br /><span class="h_subtitle">THE LEGENDS OF ADAPA, AND OF THE FLOOD</span></h3></div>

<p>Ea (originally the primal deity of the Sumerian city of Eridu and
eventually the god of the waters on and beneath the Earth) formed with
Anu, the god of Heaven, and Enlil, the god of the Earth, from the
earliest period the great triad at the head of the Babylonian pantheon.
The representation of Ea took the form of a sea-monster with a body of
a big fish, full of stars, and claws for the base of his feet.<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a></p>

<p>Ea is ordinarily known from the pretty legend woven round his mortal
son Adapa, and the command in obedience to which Adapa firmly but
unconsciously made refusal of the gift of immortality.</p>

<p>The latter, to supply his father’s household, went a-fishing in the
sea one day—fish food was evidently not the “abomination” to the
Sumerian that it was to the Egyptian gods—but suddenly Shūtu the South
Wind came on to blow, upset his sailing boat, and ducked him under
the water, or, as Adapa puts it, “made me descend to the house of my
lord,” <i>i.e.</i> Ea, god of the Sea.<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a>
In anger Adapa caught the South Wind and broke her
wings.<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a>
But for this assault he was haled to appear in heaven before Anu, who
had noticed, or had learnt through his messenger,<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a>
that the South Wind had ceased, according to the earlier
or Eridean account, to blow for seven days.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<p>Before setting out Adapa was bidden by Ea to put on garments of
mourning to propitiate the two gods, Tammuz and Gishzida, guarding the
portals of heaven, but was warned not to touch at any hazard what he
purposely misnamed the “Bread of <i>Death</i>,” or the “Water of <i>Death</i>,”
which would be offered unto him.<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a>
He could, however, accept the garment and the oil when likewise presented.</p>

<p>At the interview the guardian gods interceded so successfully with Anu
that his wrath waned; he granted a pardon, and decided that as Adapa
had seen the interior of heaven, he should be added to the company of
the gods.</p>

<div class="figleft">

   <p class="f90">From Karl Frank,<br /><i>Babylonische<br />Beschwörtunge Reliefs</i>,<br /> p. 80.</p>
</div>

<p>He therefore commanded that the “Bread of Life” and the “Water of Life”
should be brought forth; but Adapa would neither eat nor drink of them,
although he put on the proffered garment and anointed himself with the
poured-out oil. And Anu, when he saw that Adapa had not partaken of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
“Bread of Life,” or of the “Water of Life,” asked him, saying, “Come,
Adapa, why dost thou neither eat nor drink?” And Adapa answered that he
had refused to eat or drink, because Ea his lord had so commanded him.</p>

<p>Whereon comes the conclusion of the whole matter, and the loss of
immortality in the last words of Anu, “And now thou canst not live!”<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a></p>

<p>Ea was regarded not only as the god of the sea, but of wisdom, somewhat
perhaps on the lines of myths common to Greece, India, and elsewhere,
which tell us that always by the way of the sea came civilisation. The
great civilisations of the world have in fact been developed round the
shores of the great seas—the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>The Assyrian legends credit Ea for the most part with good-will and
beneficent acts towards mankind.<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a></p>

<p>Prominent among these stands out his revelation, by means of a dream,
to Utnapishti of the all-destroying flood, which the gods, wroth at the
sins of mankind, had ordained, and his command forthwith to build a
ship, whose size and shape, etc., are given with much precision, <i>e.g.</i>
it was coated inside and out with bitumen and divided into cells. On
this Utnapishti and his family and servants embarked, after bringing on
board all the gold and silver they could collect, and “seeds of life of
all kinds,” and beasts, both domestic and wild.<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a></p>

<p>The Sumerian original of the Babylonian Deluge story, which has now
been recovered, corresponds with the main features of the later version.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>In both a flood is sent to destroy mankind, but in the first the
intention of the gods is revealed in time to a pious Sumerian, possibly
a priest king, Ziudsuddu, the Sumerian equivalent of the abbreviated
Semitic name Utnapishti. He escapes from the flood in a great boat,
which floats away on the waters. When the storm after seven days<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a>
has abated and the sun at last struggled out, Ziudsuddu makes a
thanksgiving sacrifice of an ox and a sheep. We find him in the end
reconciled with the great gods, who, as in the Babylonian version, give
him immortality.</p>

<p>From the incompleteness of the text it is impossible to determine
whether in the Sumerian version the episode of the birds occurs; the
probability is that it did not. As is but natural, the earlier story is
simpler and more primitive in style than the Babylonian.<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a></p>

<p>In the Gilgamesh account of the Flood, which in general resembles the
story as given by Berosus, the absence of the raven, in the Bible the
return of the dove with an olive leaf in her mouth, proclaims the
abating of the waters, while the Algonkins allot the <i>rôle</i>, on the
failure of the raven, to the muskrat. But, in the Indian legend it is
a <i>fish</i>, not a god, which not only conveys to Manu the beneficent
warning of the coming deluge but also saves him eventually by drawing
his ship to a northern mountain.<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a></p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XXXV<br /><span class="h_subtitle">FISH—VIVARIA—THE FIRST INSTANCE OF POACHING</span></h3></div>

<p>We find in two important sources of our knowledge of Assyria (proper)
references to beasts or fishes of the sea and of the river.</p>

<p>The first occurs in <i>The Broken Column</i> of Tiglath-Pileser I., in whose
reign Assyria attained to high prosperity. This king, the first of that
country to leave behind a detailed record of his achievements, was,
as we have seen, a mighty hunter. After recounting his many military
campaigns he adds in Column IV. a list of the beasts and fish which he
had taken in his hunting expeditions. The text runs:—</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>1. The gods Ninurta and Nergal, who loved his priesthood, (the task) of hunting in the field,</p>
<p>2. Entrusted unto him, and in ships of the land of Arvad</p>
<p>3. he sailed, and he slew a mighty dolphin in the sea.<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Then follows a <i>catalogue raisonné</i> of his famous Zoo, in which were
collected the elephants, lions, mountain-goats, stags, dromedaries,
which he captured himself or obtained (antedating Hagenbeck) “through
merchants whom he had sent out,” and other numerous “wild beasts
and fowl of the Heaven that fly, the work of his hands, their names
together with (the number of) the beasts which my &nbsp;(<span class="ws5">&nbsp;</span>)&nbsp; did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
record ... have I recorded.” In addition to these, of which “he caused
their herds to bring forth young,” we find—</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>29. “A great <i>pagûtu</i>, a crocodile, a hippopotamus (?), and beasts of the Great Sea,</p>
<p>30. the king of Musrê sent unto him and caused the people of his land to behold.”</p>
</div>

<p>We cannot determine what one of the subjects of this gift, “a great
<i>pagûtu</i>,“ exactly was. <i>Tum-su-hu</i> may possibly be the equivalent of
the Egyptian <i>emsah</i>, Arabic <i>timsâh</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a crocodile. If so, Musrê
must indicate Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a></p>

<p>The Annals of Aṣur-Nasirpal form our second document of knowledge. The
walls of his palace, lined with sculptures in relief, represent his
exploits in the field of battle and in the chase. Details are most carefully
and elaborately carved; the designs mark the acme of Assyrian art.</p>

<p>In Column III. he records<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Some men I took alive and impaled them on stakes
over against their cities.</span><a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">At that time I marched into the district of
Lebanon, and unto the Great Sea.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In the Great Sea I washed my weapons and I made
offering unto the gods.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The tribute of the kings of the sea from the
lands of the men of Tyre and Sidon and Arvad, which lieth in the midst
of the sea, silver and gold and a great pagûtu and a small pagûtu and
ivory and a dolphin, a creature of the sea, I received as tribute from
them, and they embraced my feet.</span>” </p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
This “washing,” or as it has otherwise been rendered “dipping,” of a
weapon in the sea is not to be taken, as it sometimes is, in a sense
suggesting fishing by a harpoon or spear, or as typical of victory, but
rather as a symbolical act of homage and propitiation to the unknown
deities of the deep.</p>

<p>A later Assyrian king, Asurbanipal, no doubt from the value which the
test of use in his many hunting expeditions afforded, regarded the dog
from a point of view very different from that apparently taken by some
of his subjects.</p>

<p>To judge by an old Assyrian prayer, “From the dog, the snake, and
the scorpion, and whatever is baneful may Merodach preserve us,” the
general feeling was that of fear.</p>

<p>But five clay models preserve for us representations of some of the
king’s favourite hounds, with their names inscribed upon them. The
appropriateness of their names betrays their master’s familiarity with
canine traits, as we detect from <i>Chaser of the Wicked, Conqueror of
the Foe, Biter of his Enemy, Mighty in his help, He crossed the road
and did his bidding</i>!<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a></p>

<p>At Harrān (according to al-Nadim), dogs were considered sacred and had
offerings made unto them, a statement which is strengthened by the
divine title at Harrān of <i>My Lord with the Dogs</i>, which seemingly
points to Marduk and his four dogs, the name of one of which, <i>Iltebu</i>,
“the Howler,” is as characteristic to-day as it was five thousand years ago.</p>

<p>In the Bible it is curious to note the low position of the dog. It is
rarely spoken of with approval. Possibly the existence and proclivities
of the numerous packs of pariah dogs account for the fact. Tobit seems
the only person who makes his dog his companion, and then only when on
journeys.<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a></p>

<p>Over two hundred kinds of fish are enumerated in the catalogue
of Asurbanipal’s library at Nineveh: the attachment of the fish
determinative constitutes our authority. No writer, even Dr. Boulenger,
has classified or identified the fishes of Assyrian representations as
thoroughly as Montet and others have those of the hieroglyphs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p>The task would seem more formidable, for two reasons: first, the
short time that cuneiform as compared with hieroglyph writing has
been deciphered, and the wider study which Egyptian excavation has
attracted; and second, the Assyrian artist treated his subjects more
generally and more conventionally than his <i>confrères</i> in Egypt.
Although in the sea and river scenes fish and shells are introduced,
scarcely any distinctions mark particular ichthyic species. Contrast
with this the representations of the return of Hatasu’s expedition
from the land of Punt or Arabia. Here the artists depict the fishes so
characteristically that Doenitz has identified them as belonging to the
Red Sea, and even determined the species of each.</p>

<p>We can recognise in the rivers, crabs, sometimes with a fish caught
in their claws, eels (or water-snakes), and small turtles. When the
sculptor wished to indicate the sea, he made these fish larger, and to
emphasise his point added others, which are only inhabitants of salt
water, <i>e.g.</i> the star-fish.<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a></p>

<p>Within the last five years identification<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a>
of Mesopotamian fish has been carried further by Dr. Harri Holma of
Helsingfors,<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a>
and by Professor Langdon.<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a></p>

<p>From the latter I take the following list:—</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>“1. The <i>buradu</i>, of the skate and ray type. This flat fish is the
most common of all species in Southern Babylonia from the earliest
historical period. The Sumerians knew it as the _suḥuru_ fish, and
speak of it as ‘bearded,’ referring to a kind of skate fish with long
hairs about the mouth. They mention also the ‘goat-skate,’ and the
‘lower lipped skate.’ Dr. Holma’s statement (p. 96) that the _suḥuru_
cannot be the skate, turbot, or plaice, because these have no beards,
has been contraverted, since fish of the skate type often have long
feelers at the mouth resembling a beard.</p>

<p>“2. The <i>kuppû</i>, said to be the <i>rhombus maximus</i>.</p>

<p>“3. The <i>šênu</i>, in Greek σάνδαλον, in Latin <i>solea</i>, in English
‘sole.’ <i>S̆ênu</i> means ‘sandal’ in Babylonian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p>“4. <i>Sêlibu</i>, or ‘fox fish,’ perhaps so-called from its slyness;
probably <i>Alopecias vulpes</i>.</p>

<p>“5. The <i>kalbu</i>, ‘dog-fish,’ said to be the Greek καρχαρίας κύων.</p>

<p>“6. The <i>piazu</i>, ‘pig-fish,’ <i>Galeus canis</i>, ‘sea sow,’</p>

<p>“7. The <i>puḥadu</i>, ‘lamb fish,’ perhaps <i>Pelecus</i> <i>cultratus</i>.</p>

<p>“8. The <i>balgu</i>, a fish well known in all periods, and said to be
the same as the widely spread Mongolian <i>balyq</i>, the ordinary word for
fish in Turkish; in some parts the sword fish, in others the ‘bull
head.’</p>

<p>“9. The <i>qarshu</i>, probably the ‘shark,’ or a fish of prey of the
Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>“10. The <i>gallabu</i>, ‘barber,’ not yet identified.</p>

<p>“11. The <i>simunu</i>, ‘swallow fish,’ by some identified with the
‘flying fish.’</p>

<p>“12. The <i>zingur</i>, supposed to be the ‘sturgeon.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Other fish names, especially Sumerian, remained unidentified till (in
May, 1918), Langdon translated the only hymn (yet published) to Ninâ,
the Fish Goddess, and spouse of Tammuz. Among its twelve fish we get
the ‘electric fish’ (query the νάρκη), the ‘nun fish,’ the ‘fire fish
of the sea,’ and the ‘swallow fish.’ The touching lines bewailing the
death of Tammuz are, alas! imperfect.<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a></p>

<p>Fish abounded in the Two Rivers. Euphrates fish were so plentiful that
they could be caught simply in one’s hand, apparently without any
“tickling.”<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a>
The coast folk could not cope with their catches.<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a>
Wicker traps, automatically opened and shut by the tides, yielded their “harvest of ocean.”</p>

<p>Sluice gates were far commoner in Assyria than in Palestine. The
numerous rivers, and scientific system of irrigation which from earliest
ages threaded Sumeria and later on Western Assyria, account for the frequency.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p>According to Sir W. Willcocks, “The granary of the ancient is destined
to be that of the modern world.” The success of the irrigation works,
at Hit and elsewhere, may verify his prediction.<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a></p>

<p><i>Vivaria</i>, or fish-dams, known only late in Palestine, were early and
generally constructed in Mesopotamia. As adjuncts of Sumerian temples,
they can be traced as far back as 2500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> No decent-sized
township eventually lacked, or could afford to lack, these <i>piscinæ</i>
with their ever-ready supply of fresh fish.</p>

<p>The keeper, or fisherman, attached to the temples (according to
Langdon) seems to have been called <i>Essad</i>, a term which subsequently
came to mean Tax Gatherer. It is open to doubt whether the latter
meaning can, as has been suggested, be derived from or connected with
the former on account of his extraction of a toll for fish caught by
the public in the stew-ponds of the priests, or of a percentage, in
lieu of pay, of the fish caught by him for use in the temples.</p>

<p>How real was the importance attached to fish, and how recognised its
value as a food, can be discerned from early Sumerian documents. The
excavations of Telloh furnish an elaborate description of the new
temple built by Gudea in honour of Ningirsu. We read that with this
god went also other deities, such as his musician, his singer, his
cultivator of lands, and his guardian of fishponds.<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a></p>

<p>Then, again, among the officials who were deprived of office by
Urukagina, on account of the profits illegally secured by farming out
the public revenue, we come across the <i>Inspectors of Fisheries</i>. The
drastic reforms and the thorough cleansing of the bureaucracy initiated
by this monarch sprang from his desire to improve the condition of his
poorer subjects, who for years had suffered from the oppression of
the rich or the venality of public functionaries. How general and how
numerous <i>vivaria</i> had early become shows in the plaint that “if a poor
man built himself a fishpond, his fish was taken; he received neither payment nor redress.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>A document of the twenty-first century brings to light
further evidence of the economic importance of fish and of
the rights of fishing, and what to us modern fishermen is of
intenser interest—the first case on record of Poaching!</p>

<p>This occurred in the reign of Samsu-iluna, the successor
to the great Hammurabi. The latter’s Code of laws of 287
sections was considered on its discovery some twenty years
ago to be a Digest of Babylonian decisions, but the recent
finding of a clay tablet, clearly the prototype of the Code,
proves its Sumerian origin.</p>

<p>It not only illuminates vividly the social and economic conditions
of Babylon, but established for generations the status, the rights,
the duties flowing from contracts or arising from injury.</p>

<p>Its scope is curiously wide. It includes, for instance,
provisions to meet such rare cases as injuries which resulted
in the miscarriage of women. The similarity of enactment
in these cases and in divorces demonstrates <i>inter alia</i> how
marked was the Code’s influence on the Mosaic legislation some
seven centuries later.</p>

<p>Every one of Hammurabi’s subjects could by its help
acquire a clearer conception of his individual property. The
letter or rescript of Samsu-iluna shows that rights of fishing
were acknowledged and enforceable.</p>

<p>The Rescript runs:—</p>

<p class="blockquot2">“<span class="smcap">Unto Sin-idinnam, Kar-Sippar, and
the Judges of Sippar say, Thus saith Samsu-iluna. They have reported (unto me)
that the ships of the fishermen go down unto the district of Rabīm and
to the district of Shakanīm and catch fish. I am therefore sending
(unto thee) an official of the Palace Gate. When he shall reach thee,
the ships of the fishermen which are in the district of Shakanīm (shalt
thou ...<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a>)
and thou shalt not again send the ships of the fishermen down
into the district of Rabīm or the district of Shakanīm.</span>”<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

<p>This letter confirms what had previously been only surmised, <i>viz.</i>
that the inhabitants of certain districts had enjoyed the exclusive
right of fishing in their home waters. “It has already been inferred,”
King continues, “that the duty of repairing the banks of rivers and
canals, and of clearing the waterways, fell upon the owners of property
along the banks, and it was no doubt as a compensation for this enforced
service (or <i>corvée</i>) that the fishing in these waters was preserved.”</p>

<p>Mesopotamia and Armenia did not lack in fish of unusual, even fatal,
properties. Thus of certain fishes near Babylon Ælian tells us<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a>
on the authority of Theophrastus, when the irrigation streams were
without water, they remained in any small hole which was moist or held
a little water, and were able to find a living in the herbage which
grew in the dry channels, etc. Pliny (IX. 83) gives a somewhat similar
story but a more detailed description of these fish, which “have heads
like sea-frogs, the remaining parts like gudgeons, but the gills like
other fish.” Emerging from their water holes, they travel on land for
food, moving along with their fins, aided by a rapid movement of their
tail. If pursued, they retreat to their holes and make a stand.</p>

<p>He notices too the stay-at-homeness of the fish in the Tigris and of
those in the lake Arethusa. Though the river flows in and out of the
lake, the denizens of the one are never to be found in the other.
We discern the reason for such estranged relations in his previous
sentence, “the waters of the lake support all weighty substances and
exhale nitrous vapours.”<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a>
Ktesias mentions a spring in Armenia, the fishes of which are quite black
and, if eaten, prove instantly fatal.<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a></p>

<p>The only spring of sweet-smelling water “in toto orbe,” Chabura, lies
in Mesopotamia. The reason (according to legend) for its possessing
this unique property was because in it the Queen of Heaven, Juno, or
presumably her Babylonian counterpart, was wont to bathe.<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a>
But Pliny fails to indicate whether the unique scent was an effort of
Nature to supply a bath meet for the Queen of Heaven, or was merely
a by-product of her lavation. Possibly the fish of Chabura (like the
thyme fish) exhaled a “most sweet scent,” and so effected “the sweet
smelling.” But probably to preserve their power, “they will come to
feed from men’s hands.”<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>

<p>I have adduced sufficient proof that fish were plentiful in
Mesopotamia. Additional testimony has needlessly been sought in
Professor Sayce’s now fairly accepted suggestion that the ideogram for
Nineveh implies the House of the Waters or of Fish.<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a></p>

<p>Another explanation of Nineveh as <i>The Lady of the Waters</i> deduces from
Ninâ (said to be a daughter of Ea and a fish goddess) lengthening into
Nineveh. But the term <i>The Lady</i>, <i>i.e.</i> The Lady <i>par excellence</i>, in
Assyrian especially applies to Bêlit the spouse of Asur, who became
generally identified with Ishtar of Nineveh.<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a></p>

<p>If <i>The Lady of the Waters</i> translate correctly the ideogram of
Nineveh, the term may have sprung from a temple to this reputed Fish
Goddess standing in that city. But even if the existence of such a
temple can be inferred, its original site probably lay in Sumerian
Lagash, not in Nineveh.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>
<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XXXVI<br /><span class="h_subtitle">FISH IN OFFERINGS, AUGURIES, ETC.</span></h3></div>

<p>The Sumerian records leave no possibility of doubt as to offerings of
fish being made to the deities, not exclusively or specially to a deity
of fish. They show Eannatum in early days offering at Telloh certain
fish to various gods to secure their aid that the treaty which he had just
concluded with the city of Umma might be maintained for all time unbroken.</p>

<p>Similar offerings present themselves all through the history of
Assyria. Numerous tablets detailing the nature of the enjoined
offerings include fish, and as numerous receipts by the temples
acknowledge offerings of fish.<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a>
In the course of time votive offerings in ivory and bronze, etc.,
according to King, took the place of actual fish.<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a></p>

<p>The striking resemblance of the institution of the Scape-Goat in
Palestine to the ancient <i>Mashhulduppu</i> or Babylonian Scape-Goat, both
in object and high ceremonial ritual, is noted in my Jewish chapter.<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a>
But we cannot for one moment assume that sacrifices and oblations in
Assyria evolved from perhaps the earliest primitive, <i>i.e.</i> human,
sacrifice, or followed the same lines as those of Israel or of Rome.
In the first nation human sacrifice probably prevailed in the earlier
times to a wide extent, and in the second (as Varro indicates) “Populus
pro se ignem animalia mittit,” and even “pisciculum pro animis humanis”
became a not unusual and cheaper alternative.<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, we possess, in historic and prehistoric Assyria, no
trustworthy evidence of human sacrifice. Sayce, it is true, in 1875
published two texts, which, as he translated, demonstrated that human
sacrifice did prevail. These, refuted by Ball, are not accepted as even
a proper translation of the passage, much less a proof of the practice.</p>

<p>Jastrow has recently returned to the charge. He suggests that, “His
eldest son shall he burn at the Khamm of Adad,” and other passages,
establish that at one time children were offered in sacrifice, very
much on the same lines as the later Judæan immolation of their children
to Moloch, as when King Ahaz (2 Kings xvi. 3) “made his son to pass
through the fire” in the Tophet just outside the gates of Jerusalem.
But Jastrow finds even less favour now than Sayce did forty years
ago.<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a></p>

<p>Campbell Thompson, after remarking that the existence of human
sacrifice among either the Babylonian or Assyrian is not easy of
satisfactory proof, concludes, “The fact is that human sacrifice
goes out in proportion as civilisation comes in, and probably by
the time men are ready to commit their religious ritual to writing,
human sacrifice has ceased to be a regular and periodic rite: as the
Assyrians were the highest civilised of all the Semites before our
era, so in all probability fewest traces of this custom exist in their
records.”</p>

<p>A semi-religious practice, not dissimilar in object to that of the
Scape-Goat, can be discerned, if not as a vehicle for carrying away all
the sins of the people, yet as a method of ridding the individual by
the agency of some beast or fish of the affliction which lay upon him.</p>

<p>In one of the so-called Penitential Psalms or incantations, which the
tablets from the library of Asur-bani-pal bequeath us, the prayerful
desire to be free of suffering finds utterance in:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Let me cast off my evil that the birds may fly up to Heaven with it,</span>
<span class="i1">That the fish may carry off my affliction.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>
<p>This whole passage ought, however, to be regarded not as a Penitential
Psalm so much as “a ceremony for cleansing a man from <i>tabu</i>, when he
wishes to see something in a dream. It finds close connection with
the Levitical charm, originating from sympathetic magic, <i>e.g.</i> for
cleansing the leper or leprous house,” <i>i.e.</i> by the two doves, as in
Leviticus xiv. 4.<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a></p>

<p>Langdon asserts that in the Sumero-Babylonian religion each individual
in normal conditions was guided by a divine spirit or god (cf. the
δαὶμων of Socrates and the <i>genius</i> of the Romans). When a man was
possessed by the powers of evil he was estranged from his personal god,
because some demon had attacked or driven out the protecting deity from
his body. In this ancient period there seems to be no moral element
whatever in the case. If a man became <i>tabu</i> (which the eating of fish
in other countries than Assyria would involve), or possessed by some
dangerous unclean power, which made him unholy and filled him with
bodily or mental distress, this state came about solely because at some
unguarded moment a demon had expelled the indwelling god.</p>

<p>The demon had to be exorcised by some method of atonement, of which the
most important element was in Sumerian magic water, in Hebrew blood.
“In view of the great influence which Babylonian magic appears to have
exerted upon the Hebrew rituals, it is curious it did not succeed in
banishing this gross Semitic practice. Blood of animals does not occur
as a cleansing element in Babylonia,” an omission due apparently to the
culture of the Sumerians “not permitting such crude ideas, and to their
teaching those Semites with whom they came in contact a cleaner form of
magic.”<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the demons or spirits described above we find others,
which could and, unless the proper rites were paid to the dead, did
affect the living. The greatest misfortune which could befall a man was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
to be deprived of proper burial.<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a>
His shade, ran the common belief, could not reach Arallū, but wandered
disconsolately about the earth. When driven by pangs of hunger it
perforce ate the offal or leavings of the street. As the Egyptians,
to ensure the continued existence of the dead and his <i>ka</i>, provided
sepulchral offerings (the depictments of which included
fish<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a>),
so did the Babylonians, not only for a similar but also for the
additional purpose of preserving themselves from torments.</p>

<p>To leave a body unburied was not unattended with danger to the living.
The shade of the dead man might bewitch any person it met and cause him
grievous sickness. The wandering shade of a man was called <i>ekimmu</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> spectre. Only sorcerers possessed the power of casting a spell
whereby the <i>ekimmu</i> might be made to harass a man. On the other hand,
the spectre sometimes settled on a man of its own accord, in the hope
that its victim would be driven to give it burial to free himself from
its clutches.<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a></p>

<p>The Babylonian conception of the condition of the dead was an utterly
joyless one. Arallū, or the House of the Dead, was dark and gloomy.
Its dwellers never beheld the light of the sun, but sat in unchanging
gloom. The Babylonians possessed no hope of a joyous life beyond the
grave, nor did they imagine a paradise in which the deceased would live
a life similar to that on earth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<p>The nature of the under-world can be gathered from the description
given to Gilgamesh by the spirit of Enkidu risen from the grave
(sometimes cited as an instance of necromancy), “the place where was
the worm that devoured, and where all was cloaked in dust.”<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a>
The Hymn of the Descent of Ishtar into Hell goes farther:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“To the land whence none return, the place of darkness,</span>
<span class="i1">To the house wherein he who enters is excluded from the light,</span>
<span class="i1">To the place where dust is their bread and mud their food.”<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The very curious bronze of the Le Clerq collection in Paris, in which
ichthyic garments and gods of the under-world, Arallū, occur, must be
my excuse for this too lengthy and almost fishless digression on the
Babylonian dead. It shows several figures, two clad in garments of the
form of a fish, with their scales very visible.</p>

<p>Two explanations of the bronze have been offered. The first, hitherto
generally accepted, suggests that the figures are representations of
the gods of the under-world, or of the dead waiting on a sick person,
together with some demons of the under-world and two priests wearing
fishlike raiment.<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a></p>

<p>My friend Professor Langdon has furnished me with another explanation,
more detailed and more interesting.</p>

<p>This so-called representation of a scene in the lower world from
a bronze talisman has been misunderstood. The obverse has three
registers. In the upper register are depicted the seven devils, all
with animal heads, in attitude of ferocious attack upon a human soul.
The middle register represents a sick man who is supposed to be
possessed by the seven devils. He lies upon a bed. At his head and feet
stand two priests each arrayed to appear like fish: these are symbolic
of Ea, god of the sea and patron of all magic. They clothed themselves
in a fishlike robe to signify that they derived their divinations and
incantations from the sacred water, of which Ea was the god.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>In the lower register are drawings of cult utensils, such as holy water
bowls, censers, etc., and of the fever demon Labartu, who has been
driven from the body of the man and is in flight by boat. The reverse
of this bronze has in deep relief one of the seven devils who is in the
act of peering over the upper edge of the bronze, and gazing upon the
scene of atonement and magical healing below.</p>

<p>The cuneiform texts prescribe that fumigation, either for cleansing a
person or exorcising a demon, may be performed by the wizard, with or
without a censer, a bowl, or lighted torch.<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a></p>

<p>Apart from its permeation of Israel in legislation as indicated in
connection with Hammurabi’s Code, the influence of Assyria stands
out in other ways clearly. The semi-similarity of treatment of the
Deluge has already been noticed, while the rendering in the stories of
Sargon and Moses of a widespread legend<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a>
differs only in such points of detail as the substitution of the Nile
or (according to Arabic tradition) of a fish-pond for the Euphrates,
and of the irrigator Akki as the discoverer of the chest of reeds for
Pharaoh’s daughter.<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a>

<p>The assertion that the Old Testament is fairly saturated with
Babylonian culture and folklore, and that even in the days of the New
Testament we have not passed beyond the sphere of its impression hardly
overshoots the mark, when the similarity of these and other instances
is borne in mind.</p>

<p>The earliest point of contact between Babylon and Palestine is recorded
in Genesis xiv. 1, which makes Abraham the contemporary of “Amraphel
King of Shinar,” who most probably can now be identified with Hammurabi
in the light of the recent discoveries of Kugler.<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a></p>

<p>The first connection of Israel with Assyria proper occurs in the reign
of Shalmaneser II., in whose Monolith Inscription figures, as one of
the allies of Benhadad I. of Damascus, the name of Ahâbbu Sir’lai,
generally identified with Ahab, King of Israel.</p>

<p>Fish are discovered playing a part in auguries and divinations very
similar to their <i>rôle</i> in Rome. Augury in both nations was regarded
with deep veneration. It reached in Assyria a very high plane. It was
practised as a recognised science by a large and organised body of the
priesthood under the direct control and patronage of the King.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p>

<p>All strange occurrences in heaven or earth were referred to the seers.
Almost every event of common life was believed by the pious Babylonian
to require prophetic decision whether it boded well or ill.</p>

<p>Among the reforms undertaken by Urukagina was that of the college of
the diviners, for he tells us that “he, who hitherto received one
shekel for his work, took money no more.”</p>

<p>In the letters of Hammurabi these diviners were recognised as a
regular Guild. Knowledge of the tablets of recorded answers, which,
suiting the individual circumstances of each interrogator, had for
generations been stored in the library, enabled them to render an
interpretation of practically all events. Their forecasts had resort
not only to astrology, but to other means, such as the observations of
the movements of fish, of the flight of birds, and of the entrails and
livers of sheep and other sacrificial animals, all of which were the
subject of minute inspection.</p>

<p>The Babylonians in seeking to determine the future watched carefully
the movements, etc., of fish. Although the greater part of the
known divination tablets regarding fish omens are in a sad state of
preservation, the following will serve as an example: “If fish in a
river keep in a school and steadily face up stream, in that place will
be peaceful habitation,” a deliverance hardly fraught with comfort at
times of flood or drought!</p>

<p>Then again the passage (in Ezekiel xxi. 21-22), “The King of Babylon
stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use
divination: he shook the arrows to and fro, he consulted the teraphim,
he looked in the liver,” etc., is of great interest, as evidence that
the Babylonians employed both Belomancy or divination by arrows, and
Hepatoscopy or inspection of the liver.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

more frequently than in Babylonia. There it attained but secondary
importance. The general method required the shaking or shuffling
before the image or the sacred place of the deity of a set of arrows.

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XXXVII<br /><span class="h_subtitle">THE FIGHT BETWEEN MARDUK AND TIĀMAT</span></h3></div>

<p>Following my usual course of ending the chapter on each nation with a
legend or story, in which fish or ichthyic monsters figure as direct
or indirect agents of some important event, I subjoin the only myth in
Assyrian literature which comes within this category, <i>viz.</i> the famous
fight between Marduk and Tiāmat, the monstrous creature of the deep.</p>

<p>Tiāmat, with her consort Apsū, had revolted against the gods and
brought into being a brood of monsters to destroy them. So formidable
seemed her forces that all appeals by Anshar, the leader of the gods,
to Anu, and then to Ea, were made in vain. No god would “face the
music,” till Marduk was prevailed upon to become their champion. Nor
does this grand refusal seem unnatural, when we read of Tiāmat’s
dimensions.</p>

<p>“Fifty <i>Kasbu</i>, or more correctly <i>Biru</i> (<i>i.e.</i> 300 miles), was her
length, one <i>Kasbu</i> (six miles) was her breadth, half a rod was her
mouth;” and the rest of her body of proportionate bulk!<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a>
Nor again is it unnatural that at—</p>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
How pigmy in comparison with Tiāmat appears the decadent sea-dragon
mentioned by Ignatius, on whose gut, 120 feet long, in the library of
Constantinople were written in letters of gold the <i>Iliad</i> and the
<i>Odyssey</i>!</p>

<p>Allied with Tiāmat in her fight were—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i1">Sharp of teeth and cruel of fang.”</span>

<span class="i1">They bear merciless weapons without fear of the fight.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Beowulf in his famous battle with the Dragon stands out as nobler
and braver than Marduk, inasmuch as he, a <i>man</i>, to free his country
from the Dragon’s toll of death and ravage, of his own volition seeks
out the monster. He “attacks alone, for being altogether fearless
he scorned to take an army against the foe,” whereas Marduk—the
<i>god</i>—was compelled to the duel, since he was unable to enlist a
single god. Beowulf “counted not the worm’s warring for aught,” whereas
Marduk among his preparations,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Made a net to enclose the inward parts of Tiāmat</span>
<span class="i1">And the four winds he set so that nothing of her might escape.”</span>

<p>The protagonists (literally protagonists, for behind Marduk cowered
the shrinking gods, and behind Tiāmat her spouse and her spawned
monsters) on meeting consume time, quite in the grand Homeric manner,
by launching taunts and reproaches at each other.</p>

<p>Eventually Marduk, after spreading out his net to catch her, seems to
have anticipated the gassing tactics of the Huns by many millenniums,
and owing to the absence of a mask with even greater success, for—</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br /><span class="h_subtitle">ROD NOT EMPLOYED IN SPITE OF CLOSE INTERCOURSE WITH EGYPT—<br />REASONS SUGGESTED FOR ABSENCE</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The absence of any mention of Angling in Israel, and in Assyria causes
wonder and surprise, especially when we remember that the relations of
both nations in trade and intercourse with Egypt, where Rod fishing did
obtain, appear when at peace constant and close.<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a></p>

<p>In the Assyrian chapter the vexed question of the earliest date
assignable for the invasion or cultural permeation of Egypt by Sumerian
or Semitic influences has been considered, and the conflicting views
stated.</p>

<p>A fair consensus of agreement holds that the Hyksos sprang from Semitic
stock; but the dates suggested for their conquest of Egypt vary from
2540 down to 1845 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span><a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a></p>

<p>However this may be, the definite association with Egypt of that branch
of the Semitic tribes destined in Jacob’s lifetime (Gen. xlvii. 27) to
be known as Israelites,<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a>
begins with the advent of Abram into that country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<p>King, Rogers, and Jastrow in their later works have seemingly adopted
the date arrived at by Kugler from stellar researches for the first
Babylonian Dynasty. If Abram were, as is now thought, the contemporary
of Hammurabi, his flitting must have occurred between 2120 and 2080
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, but since Egyptian chronology beyond the fifteenth
century is fluid, and no early positive synchronisms with Babylon
survive, we cannot definitely designate any particular king in Egypt as
the contemporary of either Hammurabi or Abram.</p>

<p>The Bible is our main authority for the continuance of the association.
The stories of Jacob, of Joseph (in whose title <i>Abrek</i><a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a>
some detect a Babylonian influence and a connection with that of
<i>Abara-rakku</i>, the designation of one of the five great officers of
state), and of Moses, are but episodes of an intercourse which, if we
begin with Abram and end with Onias, lasted (with intervals of war and
invasion) for some 2000 years.</p>

<p>Evidence of intercourse crops up again and again throughout the four
centuries of the Jewish Monarchy. Thus we read (1 Kings iii. 1) of the
marriage of Solomon with the daughter of Pharaoh. From Solomon’s reign
onward till the birth of Christ and long afterwards, the connection
between Egypt and Israel, friendly or hostile, never fails. The flight
of Jeroboam to Shishak (1 Kings xi. 40) and the giving of presents,
probably tribute, by Hosea to the King of Egypt (2 Kings xvii. 4)
present but two instances.</p>

<p><i>Papyri</i> recently discovered prove the settlement near Assouan of a
considerable Jewish, or rather, more correctly, Palestinian colony from
(say) 500-400 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> This, like the similar but older community
at Tahpanhes, exhibits a mart of wide and keen trading. The <i>papyri</i>
“show that the Aramaic—the common language of Syria—was regularly
used at Syene (Assouan), and we readily see how five cities in the land
of Egypt speak the language of Canaan and swear to Yahweh of Hosts
(Isaiah xix. 18) as the oath in these papyri is by Yahu.”<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a>

After the destruction of Jerusalem by Antiochus Epiphanes, the petition
by Onias to Ptolemy Philometor for permission to erect a central temple
for the benefit of the many thousands of his compatriots resident
in Egypt concludes the historical evidence that I call as to the
continuance of the Egyptian-Israelitish connection. Its survival for
centuries after the birth of our Lord is a matter of common knowledge.</p>

<p>The existence of this connection rests not merely on historical
evidence. Recent excavations in Southern Palestine tell the same tale,
or even carry it still farther back, to pre-Israelite Canaan. Thus,
after referring to the tale of Sinuhé (<i>c.</i> 1970 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>),
Professor G. Barton writes, “There was apparently considerable trade
with Egypt at this time. Men from Palestine often went there for this
purpose. Such traders are pictured in an Egyptian tomb of this period.
Trade with Egypt is also shown to have existed by the discovery of
Egyptian scarabs of the time of the Middle Kingdom in the excavations
at Gaza, Jericho, and Megiddo. As Egypt was nearer, and commerce with
it easier, its art affects the arts of Palestine more than the art of
Babylon.”<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a></p>

<p>R. A. Macalister<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a>
writes: “Meanwhile the oldest foreign civilisation
of whose influence definite relics have come to light within the land
of Palestine is that of Egypt under the XIIth Dynasty.” The assertion
that “almost every spadeful of earth which is turned over in Southern
Palestine brings to light more evidence of Egyptian influence” seems
hardly an exaggeration.<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a></p>

<p>But, it may be asked, what has all this got to do with fishing? Of
itself and in itself apparently nothing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>

<p>The introduction, however, of the historical facts cannot be branded
as irrelevant. They demonstrate a constant association for over two
millenniums with Egypt, and the deep influence of Egyptian civilisation
and methods of life on Jewish policy.</p>

<p>And yet, notwithstanding such intercourse and such cultural influence,
we can nowhere in the literature of the Bible or of the Rabbis discern
either a direct mention, or (as I hope to show) an implied allusion to
the use of the Rod, which as a weapon both for market and sport from
<i>c.</i> 2000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> found favour in Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a></p>

<p>The same holds true of the Land of the Two Rivers; in no Assyrian
sculpture, on no Assyrian seal, can we detect any delineation or any
suggestion of angling, although instances of other kinds of fishing
occur frequently.<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a></p>

<p>In no book of the Old or of the New Testament can be found any direct
mention of the Rod. In the Talmud—a vast work of teaching and
discussion—the same silence prevails. The authoritative <i>Talmudische
Archäologie</i> (by S. Krauss, 1910) gives us fishful places such as Lake
Tiberias, and many points of ichthyic or piscatorial interest such as
the hook, the line, salted fish, garum, etc., but contains no reference
to the Rod.<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a>
Mr. Breslar, it is true, has recently girded up his loins to establish
that in the Bible and the Talmud can be found at any rate the <i>implied</i>
use of the Rod, but to a practical angler quite
unconvincingly.<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span></p>

<p>To account for this absence of direct mention of the Rod in the Bible
various reasons have been adduced.</p>

<p>The first: in the only two passages, Isaiah xix. 8, and Habakkuk i. 15,
where the word “angle” occurs, and in Matthew xvii. 27, “cast a hook,”
and in Amos iv. 2, as contended by Mr. Breslar, its use is certainly
implied. The validity of this claim remains a question (A) for Hebrew
scholars, and (B) for practical fishermen.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the latter, the “casting,” “taking,” etc., in
the above passages can be and probably were accomplished by a hand-line
(with or without a weight attached to insure greater length of throw)
almost as easily and as effectually as if a Rod were employed. As a
matter of fact, for taking good-sized fish some of our professional
sea-fishermen prefer the hand-line to that of the Rod.</p>

<p>The words in Matthew xvii. 27, “go thou to the sea and cast a hook”
do not either in the Greek or English strongly suggest, much less
necessarily imply, a Rod. To a professional fisherman of the Sea of
Tiberias like Peter, the more natural, probably the only known method
of casting would be by a hand-line.</p>

<p>Turning now to the Hebrew passages, Isaiah xix. 8, “The fishers shall
also lament, and all they that cast angle in the Nile (A.V., brooks)
shall mourn;” Habakkuk i. 15, “He taketh up all of them with the angle,
he catcheth them in his net, and gathereth them in his drag;” Job xli.
1, “Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fish-hook?” in all these we
find the same Hebrew word <i>ḥakkāh</i>.</p>

<p>The R.V. in the first two renders it “angle,” and in Job “fish-hook;”
in the Greek version ἄγκιστρον, which in the Septuagint is the usual
and in the New Testament (Matt. xvii. 27) the only word for hook,
occurs in all three passages.</p>

<p>Whence or from which word can the Rod be implied, or even in fairness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
claimed? In Isaiah, it is answered, from the words “cast in the Nile.”
But in a river, as every child knows, fishing is pursued by more
methods than that of the Rod. Judging from the literature of our six
Nations fishing by hand-line was far and away more general than by Rod;
the ratio between the two would indeed, I think, work out at some 100 to 1.</p>

<p>If then the words, “cast in the Nile,” do not furnish the implication
claimed, can we find any other words in the three passages which do?
The one word common to them all is <i>ḥakkāh</i>, hook: if this fail the
claimants, how or whence can they establish the implication?</p>

<p>Let us now see whither the implication from <i>ḥakkāh</i> leads us.
Obviously in Job, to <i>angling with a Rod</i> for “Leviathan” or
crocodile!<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a>
The absurdity is already manifest. Let us, however, in our hunt for the
snark-like implication examine the remaining tackle of this intrepid
angler. Fortunately for us, conjecture as to the hook or the bait is
unnecessary.</p>

<p>The Petrie collection at the University of London preserves a hook,
which in Ptolemaic times was employed in the Nile for the capture—not
of crocodiles—but merely of large fish, such as <i>Lates niloticus</i>. It
measures over one foot in length, with a shank over 2½ inches in width.</p>

<p>The account of crocodile fishing by the Egyptians left us by
Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a>
prescribes the bait—no less an one than a chine of pork. The line, then
and now (<i>ex necessitate rei</i>), must have been of stout cord, possibly tied
to a tree, with probably some protective material of horn, etc., to prevent erosion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span></p>

<p>Conjure up the picture of this Egyptian <i>piscator</i>—even in this
instance the <i>Jew</i> does not use the Rod, for there are no Leviathans
in Palestine!<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a>
Behold him “casting,” with a Rod of ancient normal length, about six
feet, with a rope line of ancient normal length, from six to ten feet,
a bait of even half the back of a porker! Surely a picture for gods and
men, more especially the winners of our Casting Competitions, to revere
with awe and envy, as a feat of strength and skill unessayable.</p>

<p>From these three passages I can find no reason, contextual or
piscatorial, to support the contention that the Rod was used, although
to us moderns such use would seem but the natural thing.</p>

<p>Mr. Breslar maintains that Amos iv. 2 authorises the implication. He
errs either in translation or through misconception of the tackle
described. The words run, “They shall take you away with hooks
(<i>ẓinnōth</i>), and your residue with fish-hooks.” The Hebrew word for
the second, <i>ṣīrōth dūgāh</i>, means only hooks, plain and simple, while
that for the first, <i>ẓinnōth</i>, signifies also thorns and probably
fish-spears, or harpoons.</p>

<p>Amos, however, far from thinking of or suggesting a Rod, is looking
contrariwise at the end of a line. His metaphor is drawn from the
non-angling custom prevalent and pictured in Assyrian representations
of a conqueror having his captives dragged by cords fastened by
presumable, but naturally not apparent, hooks firm fixed in their
lips. This conception is strengthened by the fact that <i>ḥakkāh</i> in its
primary etymological sense implies merely something connected with the
jaws.<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>

<p>If Mr. Breslar surmises (though his words convey no such hint) that
for his “rudimentary type of Rod in the Scriptures” Israel affixed a
line to his fishing spear, thus squaring with my conjecture in the
Introduction as to the evolution of the modern Rod, may I respectfully
ask why did a race, so pre-eminently alert and proverbially
acquisitive, handicap itself by the selection of such a “rudimentary
type” in preference to a weapon long invented, ready to hand, and far
superior?</p>

<p>A friend, in the hope of helping me to some authoritative information
as regards Angling, suggested <i>Jagd, Fischfang, und Bienenzucht bei den
Juden in der tannäischen Zeit</i>, by Herr Moritz Mainzer, as the very
last word on Jewish fishing. Unable (owing to the War) to obtain this
in book form, I tracked it eventually to some articles under the same
title in the magazine, <i>Monatsschrift für Geschichte und Wissenschaft
des Judentums</i> (1909). Except for a pearl or two such as “Fishermen,
then as now in Palestine, worked lightly dressed or naked,”—was this
suggested by St. John, or P. Fletcher’s, “Now when Simon heard, he girt
his fisher’s coat unto him, for he was naked”?—<i>Fischfang</i> (at any
rate) far from rewards one’s search.</p>

<p>Mainzer’s two sentences (p. 463) assist not at all in determining
whether or not the Jews used the Rod. “Die eigentliche <i>ḥakkāh</i> war ein
eiserner an eine Leine (<i>ḥebhel</i>) befestigter Haken. Die Leine selbst
konnte mit einer Rute oder einem Stabe verbunden sein der zuweilen
mehrere Schnüre mit Angeln trug” (the <i>ḥakkāh</i> proper was an iron hook
fastened to a fishing <i>ḥebhel</i>. This line might be attached to a rod or
stick, which sometimes had on it several cords with fishing hooks).</p>

<p>The supporting references come from no Israelitish source, but from
Assyrian representations of hand-lining in Layard’s <i>Nineveh</i>, and
from Egyptian delineations of Rod fishing in Wilkinson’s <i>Ancient
Egyptians</i>. Not a single word does Mainzer quote from any authority on
Jewish Angling. The words, “to a Rod which sometimes had on it several
cords with fishing hooks,” simply translate Wilkinson’s Plate 371.</p>

<p>Had I weighed the title and duly appreciated the combination of
<i>Hunting</i>, <i>Fishing</i>, and <i>Bee-culture</i>! I would have been perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
prepared for a disappointment, but the output of, or the “cultural
associations” in, a German work often defy prediction from its mere
headings. Mainzer, in his <i>Fischfang</i>, serves to recall Porson’s lines,
which are themselves but an adaptation of a Greek epigram,<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a></p>

<p>Lest my own conclusion—that neither in the Old or New Testament is
the implied use of the Rod established—carry little weight, I subjoin
the conclusions (stated in letters to me) arrived at by two well-known
Hebrew scholars.</p>

<p>The first comes from Professor A. R. S. Kennedy (the writer of the
article on Fishing in the <i>Encyclopædia Biblica</i>): “In short you are
entirely justified, so far as evidence goes, in saying that the Jews
did not use the Rod.”</p>

<p>The second comes from Dr. St. Clair Tisdall: “We find in the Bible no
proof of fishing with <i>Rod</i> and line: on the contrary the fact that no
mention whatever, direct or indirect, of the fishing Rod occurs either
in the Bible or (as far as my reading goes) in the Talmud, makes it
almost certain that the Rod was not used by the Jews. At any rate the
use of any such instrument is not implied in either Book.”</p>

<p>A second reason for the absence of the Rod may be that of dates. The
Jews, it might be urged, were not and could not be aware of Egyptian
Angling, because it sprang up subsequent to their Exodus from the
country. The reply I offer involves, it is true, that bewildering
factor, Egyptian chronology. But even if a thousand years are as
nothing in the sight of Manetho and many others, surely one epoch
correlates with another, and the shifting of one date automatically
involves the shifting of others.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p>The date of the Exodus, like most Egyptian dates, hitherto a matter of
considerable contention, is now generally agreed as falling between
1300 and 1200 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Petrie<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a>
fixes on “1220 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> or possibly rather
later,” Hanbury Brown places the Flight ten years earlier, <i>i.e.</i> 1230,
for reasons based mainly on the <i>stele</i> of King
Menephtah.<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a></p>

<p>So if the contention that the Israelites could not well know of the
Rod because of its invention after their flight holds water, any
representation of Rod fishing must obviously be subsequent to the year
1230 or 1220 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Only two such representations exist: (A) (in
Wilkinson’s Plate 370) comes from the tomb (No. 93) of Kenamūm at
Thebes, and dates from about the second half of the XVIIIth Dynasty, or
some 200 years before the Exodus, while (B) (in Wilkinson’s Plate 371,
and in Newberry’s <i>Beni Hasan</i>, vol. I. Plate XXIX.) goes back to the
early XIIth Dynasty or some 750 years before the Exodus.<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a></p>

<p>The Exodus, whatever date be assigned, probably occurred in the time
of and was occasioned by a dynasty non-Semitic, and unfavourable to
Israel. The <i>corvée</i> enforced doubtless by the kourbash was exacted
from the aliens, whose task (Exodus i. 11) included the building of two
brick fortresses to block the eastern road into Egypt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>

<p>To most of us unacquainted with the making of bricks the cruelty of
the Pharaonic command, “There shall be no straw given you, yet shall
ye deliver the tale of bricks,” seems to consist in demanding from
the sojourners the same quantity of output without their possessing,
as the Egyptian workers did possess, an essential constituent in the
brick-straw.</p>

<p>But Petrie points out that straw, so far from being an essential of the
mixture, is absent from most ancient and modern bricks. The complaint
arose because finely chopped straw is very useful for preventing the
mud from sticking to the hand, for dusting over the ground, and for
coating each lump before dropping it in the mould, thus enabling the
work to go on quickly and easily. From the strawless Jew, however,
was extorted for the same hours a tale of bricks equal to that of the
Egyptian enjoying these advantages.</p>

<p>In direct opposition to Petrie, Maspero states, and Erman<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a>
agrees, that the ordinary Egyptian brick, both ancient and modern, is “a mere
block of mud, mixed with chopped straw and a little sand.”</p>

<p>Other reasons for the Jewish unfamiliarity with the Rod, viz. its
merely local use, and their settlement in the North East of Egypt
remote from “the River of Egypt,” would fully be met, were it not for
Isaiah, with the simple statement that at present they can neither be
proved nor disproved.</p>

<p>But the words of Isaiah xix. 8, “The fishers also shall lament, and all
they that cast angle into the Nile shall mourn,” surely demonstrate—if
we allow that “cast angle” is the proper technical translation, and
that the two words cannot mean the mere throwing of a hook with a
hand-line—that the Israelites during the 430 years (Exodus xii. 40)
of their sojourn in Egypt did acquire familiarity with the methods of
fishing employed by their taskmasters.</p>

<p>Still, even if we take it as proved that for some reason Angling was
at the time of the Exodus an unknown art to the Jews, why with all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
intercourse of the subsequent centuries was the knowledge of the
existence and value of the Rod not acquired?<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a></p>

<p>Those and other queries may have found a ready reply in the reputed but
lost Book of Solomon on Fishes.<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a>
It may possibly have contained some clue, such as a command or custom,
totemistic or other, common to the old Semitic stock, or some trait
of temperament which caused Angling to be regarded as too slow or too
unremunerative a pastime.</p>

<p>Without its guidance one is almost driven to the conclusion that the
ancient Israelites (like the early Greeks and Romans) were pot-hunters,
bent on the spoil rather than on the sport of their catch, but (unlike
them) continued this characteristic throughout their history, and
remained to the end uninfected by the joy or passion of Angling. Their
desire was fish—abundant and cheap, or better still <i>gratis</i>: hence
when “fed up” with Manna (Numbers xi. 5) they fell a-lusting—“Who
shall give us flesh to eat? We remember the fish we did eat in Egypt
for nought.”</p>

<p>This apparent lack of the sporting instinct contrasts strangely with
the fact that modern Jews rank among our foremost anglers, and that to
a Jew we owe the greatest book written within the last generation, if
not the practical establishment on a scientific basis of the dry-fly,
that most finished form of Angling.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennet, Professor of Hebrew at Cambridge, while holding no brief
either way, has, at my request, most kindly suggested some reasons
which may conceivably account for the Biblical absence of Angling. To
my mind none of these affords adequate proof of its existence.</p>

<p>A. The physical characteristics of the country preclude many references
to fishing in the Old Testament. However keen their desire, the
majority of the population were in the position of Simple Simon, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
he “went a-fishing for to catch a whale.” Sea-fishing was out of
the question, for with the doubtful exception of a small bit of
the Galilæan coast—probably not held continuously—no part of the
Mediterranean sea-shore belonged to Israel during the Monarchy, while
the climate and intense heat of the Valley of the Jordan, the only real
river, kept its inhabitants apart from the dwellers on the mountains.</p>

<p>But <i>contra</i>: even if the majority were Simple Simons, the numerous
references (about 74) in the Bible to fishes, fishing, and fishing
implements indicate a wide, if perhaps impersonal, knowledge of the
practice. The fact that the larger number of these were used as
metaphors or similes evidences a more than local knowledge of fishing,
because for a metaphor or simile to be telling it usually must, as
do the Homeric, appeal to a well-known, common, and long-established
custom or craft.</p>

<p>B. Although fishing apparently prevailed always in the Sea of Galilee,
it must be remembered that practically the whole literature of the Old
Testament emanates from central and southern Palestine, and (as is the
case with Egyptian literature as regards Deltaic conditions) contains
but scant allusion to life among the Northern Tribes. Hence possibly
the silence about the Rod, which may nevertheless have been employed.</p>

<p>C. The Old Testament stories, although some belong to the same period
as the Homeric, are told in a manner very different from the latter.
Every picture is sketched with the fewest strokes, and accordingly
details are, have to be, taken for granted. Thus, although the majority
of the people subsisted largely on milk, there is not one reference to
<i>milking</i>.</p>

<p>But <i>contra</i>: this omission seems to me hardly on all fours with that
of the Rod. The word <i>milk</i>, when not expressly limited, <i>e.g.</i> “of thy
bosom,” or used metaphorically, signifies solely the lacteal liquid
extruded from the teats of an animal, and so implies <i>milking</i> or a
previous act of extrusion, whereas the word <i>fishing</i> connotes no
single method of taking <i>fish</i>, as the Old Testament in its mention
of the implements, Spear, Hook and Line, and Nets, demonstrates. Then
again Job xxi. 24 (R.V. margin), “his milk-pails are full of milk,” and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
Judges iv. 19, “she opened a bottle of milk,” both demand an extrusion
effected by one and only one method, whereas “jars of fish” may have
been filled by any piscatorial method.</p>

<p>D. There is no evidence that the Israelites brought from Egypt a single
particle of Egyptian civilisation. Nomads they were when they entered,
and nomads they were when they left Egypt. Their <i>kultur</i> was taken
over from the Canaanites, and their later civilisation, despite periods
of subjection to Egypt, owed far less to that country than to Babylonia.</p>

<p>Even if we grant that no actual evidence of Egyptian culture exists,
the probabilities incline the other way. Their abiding place was in no
sterile or out-of-the-way corner of that country, but in Goshen, where
we read “they gat them possessions therein,” and was in close proximity
to the great high road, which bore the commerce between Egypt and Asia,
and <i>vice versâ</i>. They were certainly familiar with the manufacture of
bricks, and presumably the building of houses, etc.</p>

<p>E. The verse, “The fishers shall also lament and they that cast angle
in the brooks shall mourn,” which <i>may</i> betray knowledge of the Rod, is
apparently much later than Isaiah, and may, perhaps, be assigned to the
second century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and refer to the campaign of Antiochus
Epiphanes in Egypt.</p>

<p>Even if we allow that this date accounts for all omission of Angling
during the millennium between the Exodus and this campaign, why
is there no actual or implied reference in subsequent literature,
especially in the voluminous Talmud?</p>

<p>But the Jewish lack of sport is evidenced not only in their methods of
fishing, but, what is more remarkable, in those of their hunting, or
rather non-hunting. While Assyrian, Egyptian, and Persian Monarchs were
famous for their hunting exploits, no single Jewish king, except Herod,
is handed down to us delighting in or even taking part in the chase.<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a></p>

<p>We find no Hebrew counterpart to Tiglath-Pileser, with his historical
bag of “4 wild bulls mighty and terrible, 10 elephants and 120 lions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>”
on foot, and 130 speared from his chariot, or even of a mild understudy
to Ashur-bani-pal.<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a>
The Bible gives but two—Esau’s brother scarcely ranks as
one—hunter-characters: Esau “a cunning hunter,” and Nimrod “a mighty
hunter before the Lord.” Even the latter of these two heroes was no
Israelite, but a king “of Accad,” a Sumero-Assyrian, whom some writers
identify with Gilgamesh.</p>

<p>Such indifference to or aversion from the chase cannot either at the
time of the invasion of Palestine (Exodus xxiii. 29), or subsequently
be ascribed to the lack of wild beasts or of game, for we read of
lions, bears, jackals, foxes, etc., and of hart, fallow deer, and
antelope.</p>

<p>Two reasons—neither, to my mind, satisfactory—have been advanced to
explain this attitude as regards hunting, a pursuit which admittedly
has played, both as a necessity and a pastime, an important part in the
education and evolution of mankind.</p>

<p>The first: the Hebrews, as described in the Old Testament, had already
reached the stage of pastoral nomads, when “hunting, which is the
subsistence of the ruder wanderer, has come to be only an extra means
of life.”<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a></p>

<p>The second: the Hebrews, hampered perhaps by certain peculiarities of
their religion, or on account of the density of the population were not
often induced “to revert for amusement to what their ancestors had been
compelled to practise from necessity.”<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a></p>

<p>Either, or both, of these reasons might have carried weight, had it
not been for the existence hard by in Assyria of a people, among whom,
although sprung from the Semitic stock, hunting was a recognised and
popular pastime, and this despite a population far denser.</p>

<p>Nor, again, when we compare the culture of the two nations, can
Lacépède’s previously quoted dictum that in civilisation the fisher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
nation is usually more advanced than the hunter nation help the
Hebrews, for apart from the fact of the indisputable and immeasurable
superiority of the Assyrian civilisation we discover no sign of angling
in Israel.</p>

<p>As in their fishing, they were “out for” the meat, not for the sport,
so was it, I fear, in their hunting. If they found no pleasure in
the chase, they assuredly delighted in the eating of game and were
dexterous trappers of animals. Their methods were:—</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>(<i>a</i>) By digging a pitfall for the larger animals, <i>e.g.</i> for a lion
in 2 Sam. xxiii. 20;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) By traps, which were set in the runs of the animals (Prov.
xxii. 5) and caught them by the leg (Job xviii. 9), or were set
underground (<i>ibid.</i> 10); and</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) By nets of various kinds—for an antelope in Isaiah (li. 20, R.V.).</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XXXIX<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">FISH WITH AND WITHOUT SCALES—METHODS OF FISHING—VIVARIA</span></h3></div>

<p>In Moses’ enumeration of what the tribesmen might or might not eat,
there is a careful distinction by their names of the creatures in fur
and feathers, but the fishes are merely divided (as were the animals
entering the ark into “clean and unclean,” Gen. vii.) into “all that
have fins and scales ye shall eat: and whatsoever hath not fins and
scales ye shall not eat; it is unclean unto you” (Deut. xiv. 9, 10).</p>

<p>This classification has often been assumed to have been taken from
the prohibitions enjoined by the Egyptian priesthood, but without any
authority, because we do not know what fish were actually ruled out
by their dietary canon. Moses not only limits the use of fish as an
article of food, as originally granted in the covenant with Noah (Gen.
ix. 2, 3), but fails to discriminate between fish from the sea and
elsewhere. He does, however, exclude all scaleless fish such as the
important group of siluridæ, skates, lampreys, eels, and every variety
of shell fish.<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<p>As may naturally be expected, this law and other decisions, which by
debarring so many species<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a>
of fish denied to the people a food supply at once plentiful and cheap,
were in time whittled away. Fish with “at least two scales and one fin”
were gradually permitted. Eventually, as experience proved that all
fish with scales have also fins, Israel was allowed as food any part of
any fish on which only scales were visible.<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a></p>

<p>In the west this whittling was carried even further. ’Ab. Zarah, 39
<i>a</i>, expressly states that no one need hesitate about eating the roe
of <i>any</i> fish, because no unclean fish is to be found there!<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a>
The Jews of Constantinople in Belon’s time had more scruples; debarred
of caviare proper, <i>i.e.</i> made from the roe of the sturgeon, they
discovered an excellent and legal substitute in the roe of the Carp.</p>

<p>It is a strange fact that these many references to fishing neither in
the Old, where they are mostly metaphorical, nor in the New Testament,
where they are chiefly historical, give the specific name of a single
fish family. <i>Dag</i> and <i>nun</i> are the generic terms covering all
species. The large sea fish are collectively termed “tannim.”<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a>
The fish of Tobit, of Jonah, of the Psalms, are only spoken of generically.
None of the Apostles, of whom four, Peter, Andrew, James, and John,
were professional fishermen, has troubled himself to identify by name
even the actual fish of the miraculous draught.<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>

<p>The Jews acquired no intimate knowledge of the ichthyic branch of
natural history. Although acquainted with some of the names given by
the Egyptians and Alexandrians to different species (Josephus compares
a fish found in the sea of Gennesaret to the <i>Coracinus</i><a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a>)
they adopted no similar method of distinguishing them, or any classification
beyond the broad division of clean and unclean. The biological
knowledge concerning fish shown in the Talmud was of a very primitive
order, not merely in regard to embryology and propagation, but also as
to hatching.<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a></p>

<p>It does, indeed, require the firmly-shut eye of faith to conceive
that the fish of Raphael’s great <i>Madonna del Pesce</i>, which scarcely
weighs two pounds and is carried on a string by the youth Tobias, can
have been to him an object of danger and terror, or that it “leaped
out of the river and would have swallowed him” had it not been for the
Angel’s command to seize the brute (Tobit vi. 2, 3). Raphael’s cartoon
is another instance of the untrammelled liberty of the Italian artist.
Most of the fishes are mere nondescript piscine forms of artistic
fancy, but two are certainly of the Skate or Ray family, which is never
found in fresh water!</p>

<p>Then, again, how oddly Botticelli and other painters misconceive their
man-eating fish, which must have been a crocodile strayed from the
Indus or the Nile to the waters of the Tigris.</p>

<p>Fortunately Dr. Tristram<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a>
comes to our aid as regards the fresh-water fish of modern, and
probably of ancient Palestine. Of his forty-three species, only eight
are common to the more westerly Mediterranean rivers and lakes. Of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
thirty-six found in the Jordan and its affluents, but one occurs in the
ordinary Mediterranean fresh-water fauna, two in the Nile, seven in the
Tigris, Euphrates, and adjacent rivers, ten in other parts of Syria,
while sixteen are quite peculiar to the basin of the Jordan. The fish
fauna is very isolated, but shows affinities to that of the Ethiopian
zoo-geographical region, and probably dates from a geological time when
the Jordan and the rivers of North-East Africa belonged to the same
system.<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a></p>

<p>Of these fish, two demand notice.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Chromis simonis.</i> In the rare instances where fish take any care
of their eggs or young, the task nearly always devolves on the male;
here, the husband performs it by taking the ova into his mouth, till
their development in the large cheek-pouches causes such swelling that
he is unable to use his mouth. This uncomfortable condition exists and
increases until as fry about four inches long they quit the paternal
abode.<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a></p>

<p>(2) <i>Clarias macracanthus</i>, found in the Nile, as well as in the Lake
of Gennesaret. In their spawning migration they have often to travel
stretches of dwindling streams with water insufficient to cover them,
or absent altogether.<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a>
By means of an accessory bronchial organ they can live at least two
whole days out of water. When they thus behold all the wonders of
terrestrial existence, including its choicest perfection, Man, is it
surprising that they “utter a squeaking or hissing sound,” or <i>teste</i>
Masterman, “cat-like squeak”?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

<p>The methods of fishing in Palestine, like those (save Angling) of Egypt
and the ancient world, were:—</p>

<p>(A) The spear, harpoon, and bident (still used in Lebanon and Syria)
of which we read in Job xli. 7, “Canst thou fill his skin with barbed
irons, or his head with fish spears?”</p>

<p>(B) The line and hook. The line occurs only in Job xli. 1, “Canst thou
draw out Leviathan (<i>i.e.</i> the crocodile) with a fish hook (<i>ḥakkāh</i>),
or press down his tongue with a cord (<i>ḥebel</i>)?” (R.V.). The hook,
designated by several names, finds frequent place in descriptions and
metaphors in the O.T.</p>

<p>The difficult verse (Job xli. 2), “Canst thou put a rope (<i>agmōn</i>,
literally, as in R.V. margin, a rope of rushes) into his (Leviathan’s)
nose?” is possibly explained by the ordinary procedure of fishermen in
carrying their fish.<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a>
The (marginal) “rope of rushes” will recall to many a boy and many a
man how often a handy rush has served for carrying home his catch of
small fish. For the crocodile, however, such means of portage, as it is
the intent of the verse to make clear, would in Bret Harte’s parlance
be “onsatisfactory.”</p>

<p>The word, it has been held, probably means a ring, placed in the
mouth of a fish by a rope of reeds tied to a stake, for the purpose of
keeping it alive in the water. The use of a ring would give a perfect
parallelism, “a ring in his nose” and “a hook in his jaw.” Benzinger,
however, makes it very doubtful whether this practice of keeping fish
alive by a ring ever prevailed among the Jews.</p>

<p>The lure, or esca, was ground bait. Travellers maintain that even now
no Nile or Palestine fish is educated enough to rise to a fly. But
my friend Dr. Henry Van Dyke, author of <i>Little Rivers</i> and other
fascinating books, shows me from a diary kept during his visit to
Palestine in 1907 that this rule certainly has exceptions.</p>

<p>Wading from shore near the mouth of a stream flowing into Lake
Tiberias, and again near the head waters of the Jordan above the Lake
of Merom, he found pleasant clear streams where fish took the fly
willingly. Whether this departure from traditional habit was due to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
skill of the super-man, or the enticing cunning of the American flies
used, <i>viz.</i> “Queen of the Water,” “Beaverkill,” and “The Abbey” (size
No. 12 American) the diarist stateth not.</p>

<p>(C) The hand net (ἀμφίβληστρον), mentioned in New Testament, still
holds its own in the Sea of Galilee, and the coast. It in the main
resembles the Roman <i>funda</i>.</p>

<p>“It is like the top of a tent in shape, with a long cord fastened to
the apex. This is tied to the arm, and the net so folded that when it
is thrown, it expands to its utmost circumference, around which are
strung beads of lead to make it drop suddenly to the bottom. As soon as
the game is spied, away goes the net, expanding as it flies, and its
leaded circumference strikes the bottom ere the fish know its meshes
have closed on them. By the aid of his cord the fishermen leisurely
draws up the net, and the fish with it.”<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a>
A fuller description of the various nets now in use on the lake, with
an account of present-day methods of fishing, will be found in Dr.
Masterman’s interesting volume, chap. ii, <i>The Inland Fisheries of
Galilee</i> (also in Pal. Explor. Fund <i>Quarterly Statement</i>, 1908, p. 40).</p>

<p>Netting was the almost universal method. On Lake Tiberias (or the Sea
of Galilee, or Lake of Gennesaret) which yielded then, as it does now,
a most copious supply of fish, night lines and line and hook were also
in vogue. The highest value was attached to these fisheries. According
to tradition one of the so-called Laws of Joshua, while reserving
certain privileges to dwellers on its shores, opened its waters to
every comer. Weirs and fences, because of the damage their stakes
inflicted on fishing boats, were strictly forbidden.</p>

<p>The observance of this custom may have originated from a compact
made by all the tribes, as the Talmud states, or from “the blessing”
(in Deut. xxxiii. 23) conditioning the allotment of the territory of
Napthali and the Sea of Tiberias—“Possess thou the sea, and the south“
(“the sea” is the alternative version in R.V. for “the west”); or
perhaps (according to Baba Kamma) from an absolute order of Joshua to
the tribe of Napthali (<i>Jew. Encyc.</i>, v. 404).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>

<p>By law, or rather custom, fishing was, except in private <i>vivaria</i>,
etc., universally free; thus “in the Sea of Tiberias fishing with hook
and net was everywhere allowed” (Krauss, <i>Talmud Archäol.</i>, ii. 146,)
with references to Bab. Kam. 81<sup>b</sup>. Cf. the Roman Digest which lays down
that “<i>omnia animalia quæ terra, mari, cælo capiuntur, id est feræ
bestiæ, et volucres, et pisces, capientium fiunt</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a></p>

<p>Mainzer, however, severely restricts this freedom of fishing.<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a>
“Incidentally information is given of a modification of the regulation.
For instance, if any one set up a net on a shore or a bank, others were
not allowed to fish in proximity to it. They were only allowed to cast
their nets at a distance of one parasang away.”</p>

<p>This sentence apparently implies that the first comer to some position
on land acquired a legal temporary possession of fishing for the
distance of a parasang. This regulation (extracted, apparently,
from the reference 5, <i>i.e.</i> to Baba Bathra, 21 b) came into being
(according to Rabbi Gershom, as cited by Mainzer), “because the
fisherman scatters bait in the water which attracts the fish to his
net. But if another person sets up his net near by, the fish at the
sight of the fresh bait would swim to the other spot, and so the first
fisherman would suffer loss.”</p>

<p>The first (comer), adds Mainzer, “by the setting up of his net has
acquired a priority claim over all the fish of a definite area.”</p>

<p>This theory of possession appears to me quite untenable, for two reasons.</p>

<p>The first, because no words, judgment, or even <i>obiter dictum</i>
contained in the reference given, support it. A Rabbi’s pious opinion
does not suffice, as Baba Bathra, 21<sup>b</sup>, makes clear.<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a>
The passage runs:</p>

<p>“Rabbi Hona said, ‘If a man who lives in a passage has set up a mill,
and another in the same passage comes and likewise sets up one, the
former has the right to prevent him, for he can say to him, Thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
cuttest off my means of livelihood.’” In support may be quoted: “The
fish net must be removed from the fish which another is already trying
to catch as far as to allow the fish to escape.” “How far is that?”
Rabba, son of Rabbi Hona answered, “As far as a parasang.” The case is
otherwise with fish to which lines have been cast.”<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a></p>

<p>My second reason is the manifest absurdity of the enormous area
allotted to the individual netter. Our latest authority, Westberg,
computes that the parasang was equal to 3 miles 1335 yards, or about
3<small><sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub></small> miles
<i>Klio</i>, xiv. 338 ff.).<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a></p>

<p>Let us now see how this parasang possession works out on Lake Tiberias,
the only sheet of water where netting widely prevailed.</p>

<p>Its extreme length is about thirteen miles: its greatest width less
than seven. Allowing for sinuosities of coast line, let us concede
fifty miles in circumference. This extent of shore, if the area of a
parasang is possessed on only one side of the netter, would suffice for
13½ netters, or, if on both sides, for 6¾ netters, <i>i.e.</i> a monopoly on
the most prolific water, which, in Euclidian parlance, “is absurd.”</p>

<p>If we disregard the words “set up a net on a bank,” and allow that
the parasang possession holds merely for the surface area, we are
immediately confronted by two different questions.</p>

<p>First, does this allotted space spread from the boat by a parasang
only North, or by a parasang only South, etc? Second, if not, but
extends for a circumference of which the boat is the centre, how is the
possessory area to be measured, known, or shown? Oppian, it is true,
sings with poetical license of “Nets, Which like a city to the floods
descend,” but even he does not vouchsafe to us a picture of netting on
such a grandiose scale as seven and a half miles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p>Before this area of possession can be definitely established, far
weightier authority must be produced than a casual sentence from a
commentator, whose very lateness of date is betokened by his employment
of the Persian word, <i>parasang</i>.</p>

<p>In dealing with the Talmud, we must always bear in mind that a large
part was written as late as between (say) 250 and 550 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,
and by men dwelling mostly at a distance from the Holy Land, who not
infrequently show themselves unfamiliar with or ignoring the conditions
of the earlier days.</p>

<p>In early times, possibly because of the small coast-line and poor
harbours which Palestine possessed on the Mediterranean, little or no
reference to fishing on the coast crops up. Later, a considerable trade
in fish, salted or pickled, was carried on by the Syrians (some writers
even claim a monopoly in such fish for the Phœnicians) at Jerusalem,<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a>
where undoubtedly in the northern part of the city a market gave its
name to the neighbouring Fish-Gate.</p>

<p>Perhaps to avoid a similar monopoly, definite and strictly enforced
prices were periodically fixed by the authorities of the town of
Tiberias. By the time of Our Lord thriving fisheries had grown up on
the coast, especially in the neighbourhood of Acre, so thriving indeed
that the equivalent (in later Hebrew) for “carrying coals to Newcastle”
or γλαῦκ’ Ἀθήναζε, became “taking fish to Acco.” On the Sea of Galilee
in especial did the industry prosper; one town seems to have been built
up by—it certainly derived its name, Taricheæ—from the trade of
salting fish.</p>

<p>Four ways of preparing fish were according to custom<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a>
pickled, roasted, baked, or boiled; with the latter, eggs were permissible.</p>

<p>The absence of <i>vivaria</i> till a very late period presents another
instance of the lack in the ancient of the alertness so typical of
the modern Jew. It is hard to deduce why Israel neglected to borrow
from Egypt an institution yielding so valuable and lucrative a supply
of food. If the spirit of sport, which was one of the attractions of
these ponds to the Egyptian gentry, did not appeal in Palestine, the
advantages of a ready store, during the hot weather, of fresh fish
would surely have been obvious to and eagerly utilised by a race whose
passionate plaint was for “a plenty of fish.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span></p>

<p>Their great Eastern neighbour inculcated the same object lesson. Most
Assyrian towns and temples possessed an artificial or semi-artificial
<i>piscina</i>. Yet not till some 1600 years after the Exodus do we glean in
the Talmudic term <i>bibar</i> (an attempt at transliteration of the Roman
word, <i>vivaria</i>, which of itself betokens the lateness of the effort)
the first indication of their employment by the Jews.</p>

<p>This may read as flat heresy, when compared with Isaiah’s words (xix.
10), “And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make
sluices and ponds for fish.” The translation, however, in the R.V.
(N.B., there is no word equalling <i>fish</i> in the Hebrew text), “Her
pillars shall be broken in pieces, all they that work for hire shall be
grieved in soul,” shatters the assertion that <i>vivaria</i>, or fish lakes,
were early institutions in Palestine. This shattering is complete, when
the only other buttress, the passage in Canticles vii. 4, “Thine eyes
(are) like the fish pools in Heshbon,” falls to the ground with the
R.V. rendering, “Thine eyes are as the pools of Heshbon.”</p>

<p class="space-below2">If the Israelites, on the one hand, lacked
till late the constructive ability of the Romans with regard to
<i>vivaria</i>, they, on the other, seem to have lacked or failed to apply
the destructive devices employed by the latter for the wholesale
slaughter of fish by poison and drugs, made familiar to us by Oppian
and Ælian.</p>

<p class="blockquot2"> <span class="smcap">Note.</span>—With reference
to Mainzer’s absurd contention, Prof. Kennedy writes me as follows:
“Naturally the working of the large drag net required considerable
elbow-room, and it was understood, as Krauss points out (<i>Talm.
Archäol.</i>, ii. 145), that a fisherman would not encroach on his
neighbour’s ground. If we assume, for the sake of argument, that the
ancient drag was as long as those used by the Galilean fishermen of
to-day—<i>i.e.</i> about 400 metres (437 yards) according to Masterman (<i>op.
cit.</i>, 40)—a boat’s crew, working from the beach and spreading their
drag in a semi-circle, would not monopolise more than 250-280 yards
of sea-front, a very different ‘proposition’ from the Talmud’s or
Mainzer’s parasang.” </p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XL<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">ICHTHYOLATRY IMPROBABLE—FISH NOT IN SACRIFICES OR AUGURIES</span></h3></div>

<p>Although nothing is said of sacrificial fish, it is possible that
Ichthyolatry did prevail in Israel to some extent. In Deut. iv. 18,<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a>
we find an express commandment or law laid down by Moses against the
making of a graven image of “the likeness of any fish that is in the
water under the earth”: in Exodus xx. 4, we read, “Thou shalt not make
unto thee a graven image, nor the likeness of any form that is in
heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water
under the earth.”</p>

<p>If Ichthyolatry existed, it could hardly have sprung up among a nomad
people living in the Desert, as did the Jews for years before they
entered the Promised Land. Such a cult with other customs was probably
adopted from the Canaanites by their conquerors. Psalm cvi. 35 ff.,
expressly tells us, “but they mingled themselves with the nations and
learned their works; and they served their idols which became a snare
unto them.” Any argument in favour of the existence of Ichthyolatry
which rests mainly on Deut. iv. 18, and Ex. xx. 4, can to my mind carry
little or no weight. They simply embody a comprehensive command against making
a graven image of any kind whatever, celestial, terrestrial, or aquatic.</p>

<p>As to the observance of the commandment, Petrie writes:—<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> “It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
often assumed that the prohibition to make a graven image was as
rigidly carried out in Israel as in Islam—the second monotheistic
revival of the Semites. The holy of holies in Solomon’s Temple
contained, however, two enormous cherubim, about 17 feet high, side
by side, right across the back of the shrine.... Not only were these
figures in the holiest place, but in the court stood the brazen sea
on twelve oxen, and figures of lions, oxen, and cherubim covered the
tanks. In earlier times Micah had a graven image, and a molten image
of silver, weighing about six pounds, in his private chapel of Yahweh,
served by a Levite, and they, with the ephod and teraphim, were adopted
for tribal worship by part of the tribe of Dan until the captivity.”</p>

<p>The author adds “there was neither officially nor privately any
objection to the use of images.” He also shows that even “in the
holiest of all things, the Ark of Yahweh, there were cherubs, one on
each side of the mercy seat, with their wings covering the mercy seat,”
in which design and other religious matters he discerns clear instances
of Egyptian influence.</p>

<p>However this may be, it is plain from Ezekiel (viii. 10-11) that the
Israelites worshipped graven representations of “every form of creeping
things and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the House of Israel,
pourtrayed up on the wall round about. And there stood before them
seventy men of the elders of Israel ... with every man his censer in
his hand: and the odour of the cloud of incense went up.” Some scholars
go indeed as far as the assertion that until the prophetic reformation
in the seventh and sixth centuries <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the <i>popular</i>
religion of Israel was about on a level with unreformed Hinduism.</p>

<p>We stand on surer ground in the statement that Ashtoreth, a goddess of
the Zidonians and Canaanites, was worshipped by Israel, for in 1 Kings
xi. 5 and 33, we read “Solomon went after Ashtoreth, the goddess of the
Zidonians,” and, “because they have forsaken me and have worshipped
Ashtoreth.”<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a>
From this acknowledged worship of Ashtoreth, sometimes identified with
Astarte and with Atargatis<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a>
—undoubtedly a fish goddess—Ichthyolatry has been claimed for Israel.

Atargatis, see <i>ante</i>, 127.]</p>

<p>But Cheyne, after showing that the mistake of identification arose from
Carnaim, where (Maccabees v. 26) the temple of Atargatis stood, being
also called (Gen. xiv. 5) Ashtoreth-Carnaim, disputes the deduction,
and denies that these goddesses were one and the same. He points
out that at Ascalon there were two separate temples, one to Astarte
(Ashtoreth) and one to Atargatis (Derceto), standing side by side.<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a></p>

<p>Strabo, however, states (XVI. p. 748) that in Hierapolis, or Bambyce,
or Magog, “there was worshipped the Syrian goddess Atargatis,” and
on p. 785 that this same goddess is called by the historian Ctesias
Derceto, and by others Athara. In Strabo’s day apparently the name, if
not the cult, of Atargatis and Ashtoreth were considered identical.<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a></p>

The origin, the nature, and the worship of Dagon, the fish god of the
Philistines, whose temple stood at Ashdod,<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a>
are discussed in Chapter xxxiii.</p>

<p>The Scape-Goat is perhaps the best known of the Israelitish offerings
to the deity. The annual ceremony of “the driving away” became a
service of the highest pomp and solemnity. For it two goats were
necessary: the first to be drawn by lot was killed as a Sin Offering
unto Yahweh, the second, the Scape-Goat, after being laden by the High
Priest with all the sins of the people for the past year, was sent away
into the wilderness, “to Azazel” (Levit. xvi. 8, 10, R.V.).</p>

<p>This symbolic bearing away of the sins of the people is somewhat
analogous to that in Lev. xiv. 4 ff., where for the purification of the
leper one bird is killed, and the other, charged with the disease, let
loose in the open field. In Zech. v. 5 ff., Wickedness is carried away
bodily into the land of Shinar.</p>

<p>The resemblance of this periodic offering<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a>
and of many other Jewish institutions to those of Babylon is
striking. The letting loose and driving away of the <i>Mashhulduppu</i>,
or Scape-Goat, was similarly the occasion of an annual ceremony of
imposing ritual. The first account of this appears in an inscription
of the Cassite period, which avows itself merely a copy of an earlier
record, the original of which may well have existed in the time of Hammurabi.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span></p>

<p>To fish figuring as symbolical bearers away of sins we have references,
according to Pitra,<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> in the Talmud, though not in the Bible. On New
Year’s Day (about mid-September), when in the fulness of time God will
judge mankind, it was the custom (based on Micah vii., “Thou wilt cast
all their sins into the sea”) to assemble near some lake or stream. If
goodly numbers of fish were spied, the omen of the expiation of human
sins was accepted. Forthwith the crowd jumped for joy, and shed their garments,
likewise their sins, on to the fishes, who swam away, heavily laden.</p>

<p>Religious customs in Israel and Assyria both correspond and differ.
Thus the sacrifices of fish found in Assyria are absent in Israel,
although we read <i>passim</i> of offerings of domestic animals, of wine,
of pigeons, and of doves. The former (despite Sayce and Jastrow) were
guiltless of human sacrifices, the latter “sacrificed their sons and
their daughters” (even) “unto demons.”<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a></p>

<p>From the words of Exod. xiii. 2, and Numbers xviii. 15 f., Mr. Campbell
Thompson holds that the God of Israel plainly regarded the firstborn of
men and the firstlings of animals as his own. The Israelites certainly
offered up some of their children, generally the firstborn (cf. Isaac),
either as a tribute regularly due to their Deity or to appease his
anger at times of calamity or danger.<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a>
Other writers disavow a general sacrificing of the firstborn as part of
the religion of Israel; they attribute individual instances occurring
towards the close of the monarchy to the influence of surrounding
nations.<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a></p>

<p>I have come across no counterpart to the Babylonian or Roman custom of
taking auguries or making oracular responses from the movements, etc.,
of fish. If the Hebrews apparently lacked some modes of divining which
were employed by the Greeks, Romans, Arabs, etc., such as observation
of the flight and cries of birds, the movements of fish, the inspection
of the entrails of animals (for it was a King of Babylon, not of Israel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
who “looked in the liver”), the Bible reveals signs and omens
resembling or identical with those in use elsewhere.</p>

<p>We read, for instance, of <i>Rhabdomancy</i>, or divination by rods, “my
people asketh counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto

<p>Strabo reports as attached to the Temple at Jerusalem a class
of official dreamers, apparently for purposes of divination or
prophetic deliverances. Of the important part played by dreams in
both the Old and New Testaments, those of Jacob, Joseph, Solomon,
and Joseph the husband of Mary, are <i>inter alia</i> evidence. In the
Temple institution<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a>
may possibly be detected the continuance of the Semitic pre-Mosaic
custom of sleeping places before a temple (as at Serabīt-al-Khādim)
for dreamers<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a>
in quest of omens, although the references to it in the O.T. itself are
very slight, and only occur in connection with Bethel stones and
Seers.<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a></p>

<p>The Seers were a recognised class of persons, who by an exceptional
gift could disclose to inquirers secrets of the present and immediate
future (1 Sam. ix. 6, and x. 2-6). Samuel himself belonged to the
college or class of Seers. Like the diviners, they received fees; thus
Saul’s servant suggests the giving to the Seer, whose words invariably
come to pass, “a quarter of a shekel of silver.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></p>

<p>As regards the diviners, etc., we find in Isaiah ii. 6, “Thou hast
forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be filled with
customs from the East and are soothsayers like the Philistines,” and
in Deut. xviii. 10-12, “one that useth divination, or practiseth
augury, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer, or a charmer, or a consulter
with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer,” all these are
abominations unto the Lord.<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a></p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XLI<br /><span class="h_subtitle">THE FISH OF TOBIAS—DEMONIC POSSESSION</span></h3></div>

<p>The fish in Tobit, apart from its ichthyic, possesses two other points
of interest, its magical and its medical power. As in Assyria we have
found beliefs in magical charms very prevalent, and exorcisms of demons
or devils accomplished by various methods, so with the Jews, especially
with the Babylonian Jews, the interest in magical charms was very
strong, and the means employed for exorcism very similar.</p>

<p>In both nations it is necessary to have some object into which the
spirit may be attracted or driven, in point of fact a Leyden jar in
which the malign influence may be isolated under control. It is all the
same whether the devils are sent into the Gadarene swine or the jinni
corked up in the brass bottle of Solomon. The disease (or oppressing
devil) must be gently or forcibly persuaded to leave the human body and
enter the dead animal or waxen figure close at hand, and so be brought
into subjection, or by cleansing with water or fumigation (often with a
censer) banished, and its possession or persecution of the person made
of no effect.<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a></p>

<p>As nowadays even Macaulay’s schoolboy wots little of the Apocrypha, a
short résumé of the book of Tobit seems not amiss.</p>

<p>Tobit has become blind, and fallen on evil days in Nineveh; he bids his
son Tobias set forth and fetch a sum of money deposited with Gabael in
Media. He chooses as a trustworthy companion Azarias, who turns out to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
be no other than the angel Raphael, whom God, compassionating both
Tobit’s plight and Sara’s subjection to a demon, has sent purposely
from heaven.</p>

<p>On the journey Tobias (R.V.) “went down to wash himself in the Tigris
and a fish leaped out of the river and would have swallowed him. But
the angel said unto him, ‘Take hold on the fish.’” And the young man
caught hold of the fish and cast it on the land. The angel bids him,
“Cut the fish open, and take the heart, the liver, and the gall, and
put them up safely,” giving as his reasons, “touching the heart and
liver, if a devil or evil spirit trouble any, we must make a smoke
thereof before the man or woman, and the party shall be no more vexed.
As for the gall, it is good to anoint a man that hath white films in
his eyes, and he shall be healed.” Of the healing of his father’s
blindness we read later in xi. 11-13, where Tobias “strake of the gall
on his father’s eyes.”</p>

<p>The great act of the drama, however, is staged in Ecbatana, where
the travellers break their journey at the house of a kinsman Raguel,
whose daughter Sara “had been given in marriage to seven husbands, but
Asmodeus the evil spirit (or demon) slew them before they had lain with
her.” Tobias, not to be daunted, marries Sara, not, however, before
Raguel “took paper and did write an instrument of covenant (or marriage
contract) and sealed it.”</p>

<p>“And when they had finished their supper, they brought Tobias in unto
her. But as he went he remembered the words of Raphael, and took the
ashes of the incense, and put the heart and the liver of the fish
thereupon, and made a smoke therewith. But when the devil had smelled
the smell he fled into the uppermost parts of Egypt, and the angel
bound him” (viii. 1, 2, 3). Cf. Milton, <i>P.L.</i> iv. “Asmodeus of the
fishy fume,” etc.</p>

<p>Dr. Gaster has given us a version, hitherto unpublished, in which
“Tobiyah took the heart of <i>a</i> fish and put it in a censer and burnt
it under the clothes of Sarah. And Ashmedai (the demon) received the
smells and fled instantly.” This contra-demonical property in a fish
appears elsewhere, <i>e.g.</i> in the Macedonian charm, which prescribes for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
one possessed the wearing of and the fumigation with the glands of a
fish, to ensure that “the demons will flee from him.”</p>

<p>The jealous passion of demons or devils for maidens colours Asian,
African, and European folk-lores. They lie in wait for married couples;
sternly guard their so-called brides.<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a>
Otherwise they were usually innocuous. Tobias argues with the angel,
“If I go in unto her, I die as the others before: for a wicked spirit
loveth her, which hurteth nobody, but those that come in unto her” (vi. 14).</p>

<p>According to the Testament of Solomon, Asmodeus (the demon) avows, “my
business is to plot against the newly wedded, so that they may not know
one another. I sever them by many calamities, and I waste away the
beauty of virgin women.” In Asmodeus we recognise a male counterpart
of Lilith and her dangerous relations with men. The demon, in fact,
regards the virgin as his own, himself as her true and constant lover,
and resents, prevents, or “avenges any infringement of his <i>jus primæ
noctis</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a></p>

<p>The misconception, evident in the last eight words of this learned
writer, as to what constituted the <i>jus primæ noctis</i> prevails widely.
As the <i>jus</i> is the child, strange as the parentage may appear, of
the tale of Tobias and Sara, it seems worth our while to notice the
strangely erroneous views held both as to the possessor of the <i>jus</i>
and the occasion of its exercise, and shortly to explain, even at the
risk of seeming to stray from fishing into folklore, the origin and the
establishment of the custom.</p>

<p>According to popular belief the superior or lord of the fee, among
other feudal privileges, possessed, as such, the vested right of
connection with the daughters of his tenantry or of holders of land
under him on the first night of their marriages. Some writers on the
French Revolution, indeed, indignantly class the wide and brutal
exercise of this right on chaste maidens by licentious <i>seigneurs</i>
as not the least, perhaps one of the most provocative, of the social
causes, which led to the detestation and subsequent massacre of the
<i>noblesse</i> in many <i>départements</i> and to the overthrow of
the old landed system!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
But alas! “this sad old romance, this unchivalrous story” (to vary
<i>Lucille</i>) must go to the wall. The <i>jus, as thus conceived and
described</i>, never in fact existed anywhere in civilised Europe. The
figment of its ruthless exercise as a legal right by licentious
lordlings owes its existence to a vivid imagination uninfected by one
germ of truth, as Lord Hailes, M. L. Veuillot, and others clearly
demonstrate.<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a></p>

<p>It must come as a severe shock to preconceived ideas to run up against
the dull facts of history, and thence discover that the <i>jus primæ
noctis</i>, so far from being the barbarous privilege of deflowering an
unwilling bride, was merely a right accorded by the Church to the
husband on the payment of a varying fee to the bishops, etc., for the
privilege of disregarding the ecclesiastical ordinance, which required
that his bride should remain in a state of virginity for one, two, or
three days!<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a></p>

<p>Continence for one night was first enjoined in the decree passed by
the Fourth Council of Carthage in 398 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span><a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a>
This, extended to “two or three days,” figured not only in the Capitularies of
Charlemagne,<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a>
but was received into the Canon Law, and was twice repeated in the decretals
of the Catholic Church.<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a></p>

<p>But what, it may be fairly asked, has the <i>jus primæ noctis</i> got to
do with our Tobias and Sara? The history of the connection deserves
tracing, not only to clear away its obscurity, but also to show how a
custom—important in result but based simply on a variant version of
Tobit—was by the Church early adopted and widely inculcated. The days,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
during which the continence enjoined on the newly married could only be
disregarded if the husband had previously paid for the privilege a fee
to some religious authority, came to be known as “Tobias Days.”</p>

<p>No searching, however diligent, of the Septuagint or of our A. or R.
Versions, nor (it seems) of the Aramaic text of the tale of Tobit sheds
light on the origin of the custom or of the application of the name.</p>

<p>The Vulgate, however, which the Roman Church adopts, sets forth the
story of the abstinence of Tobias from Sara. “Then Tobias exhorted the
virgin, and said unto her: Sara, arise, and let us pray to God to-day,
and to-morrow, and the next day: because for these three nights we
are joined to God: and when the third night is over we will be in our
wedlock. For we are the children of the Saints, and we must not be
joined together like the heathen who know not God.”<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a></p>

<p>From this (apparently) solitary and quite different version sprang the
custom of the “Tobias Days,” and the <i>jus primæ noctis</i>, of which the
usual conception is “a monstrous fable born of ignorance, prejudice,
and confusion of ideas.”<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a></p>

<p>The custom of continence for varying periods probably springs from the
common widespread belief (of which <i>Tobit</i> affords a Semitic example)
that demons lie in wait to harm newly-married couples, and from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
hope that if allowed free scope for making love to the bride their
jealous wrath might be appeased, or the danger, at any rate, minimised.
The alternative to appeasement was deception of the demon; whence women
sometimes disguised themselves as men, and even wore false beards!</p>

<p>We find, on returning from this semi-folklore excursion, Prof. Langdon
asserting that in Sumero-Babylonian religion each individual is guarded
by a divine spirit or god.<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a>
He is called the “Man’s God,” and the man is defined, in a religious
sense, as a “Son of God.” But this term applies to no females.</p>

<p>This can hardly be attributed to accident, for our sources of
information mention hundreds, even thousands, of men bewitched, and by
demonic force abandoned by their indwelling gods, <i>but never a woman</i>.
Women not infrequently figure as causing the condition of tabu, but
never as having fallen to the powers of devils, or witches, or as
being under the protection of a personal god. They never appear in the
private penitential psalms.</p>

<p>But when we recall the high position occupied by women, not only
in Babylonian society, but also in the eye of the civil law, which
regarded their rights, as often as not, equal to those of men, and that
women are often found as priestesses of religious orders, Langdon’s
statements, resting on recent discoveries, create grounds for surprise.</p>

<p>To explain the anomaly he conjectures that when the texts refer to
sinners, penitents, or sufferers, the title “son of his god” applies in
all probability also to women.</p>

<p>The book of Tobit, whether Persian in its source or Aramaic in its
original text, furnishes an example of demonic possession of a woman, a
Hebrew of the Hebrews.</p>

<p>The Jewish conception of demonic possession resembles, indeed probably
descends from, the Babylonian. The “seven devils” of Matt. xii. 45,
Luke xi. 26, and viii. 2, simply reflect the evil spirits, called in a
famous incantation <i>The Seven</i>, who play no small part in Babylonian
mythology.<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span></p>

<p>The N.T. confines the instances of evil spirits possessing
mankind—more frequently in the psychical rather than in the physical
sense—to the Gospels and the Acts, which illustrate demonic possession
of women by (<i>inter alias</i>) the Canaanitish woman (Matt. xvi. 22) and
Mary Magdalene, “from whom seven devils had gone out” (Luke viii. 2).<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a></p>

<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XLII<br /><span class="h_subtitle">THE FISH OF MOSES—JONAH—SOLOMON’S RING</span></h3></div>

<p>The many versions of “the fish of Moses” are but delightful
explanations of the flat fish having more meat on one side than
another, or being white or colourless on one side and darkish coloured
on the other.</p>

<p>In one story the Almighty, annoyed with Moses for answering some one’s
query “Who was the most knowing of men?” with a simple “I,” instead of
accrediting his wisdom to God, revealed unto him, “verily, I have a
servant at a place where the two seas meet, and he is more knowing than
thou.” The legend, with the direction to Moses to take a fish and put
it in a measure, and the fish’s escape by God’s aid, etc., is too well
known for recital.</p>

<p>But the conclusion of Hamid of Andalusia as to the nature of the
fish is not, and may be added. “The fish of Moses which I saw in the
Mediterranean is of the breed of that <i>fried</i> fish, a half of which
Moses and Joshua ate, and the other half God revived. It is about a
span long. On one side it has bristles and its belly is covered with
a thin skin. It has but one eye and half a head. Looking at it on one
side you would deem it dead, but the other side is perfect in all its
parts.”<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a></p>

<p>To account for the difference in colour the legend of the Arabs<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a>
runs thuswise:—“Moses was once cooking a fish, and when it had been
broiled till it was brown on one side, the fire or oil gave out, and
Moses angrily threw the fish into the sea, when, although it had been
half broiled, it came to life again, and its descendants have ever
since preserved the same peculiarities of colour.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span></p>

<p>The half-destroyed fish which recovers life meets us also in the belief
which unto this day lingers in some towns on the Black Sea, but on the
<i>Rhombus</i>, not on the Sole, is the miracle wrought.</p>

<p>According to a Russian legend, the tidings of the Resurrection were
brought to the Virgin Mary, when at food: incredulous and as one of
little faith she flung the uneaten half of a <i>Rhombus</i> into the water,
bidding it, were the message true, come back to life whole! And lo!
this it instantly did.</p>

<p>Pictures of the Virgin, commemorating the incident are painted on a
<i>Rhombus</i>, nailed to a board, thoroughly dried, and ornamented with a
background of gold. A great ceremonial marks their removal to a shrine
hermetically sealed. The custom, no doubt, sprang from the belief that
fishing enjoyed the special protection of the Holy Mother.<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a></p>

<p>Mahometan tradition abounds with fish lore of the oddest kind. The
commentators of the Koran vie, indeed, with the Talmudists in the
curious subjects to which they often devote serious study, and in their
grotesqueness of invention. The learned Rabbi el Bassam seems to have
spent fifteen whole years in the vain endeavour to discover the name of
the <i>chef</i> who made the pottage for Esau!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span></p>

<p>The story of the fishes, who made a point of coming every Saturday
morning to tempt the Hebrews to the sin of catching them illustrates
Koranic invention. Thinking to avoid the sin and yet secure their
seducers, the sojourners went out, dammed the channels, and ate the
fish on the next day. But as there was, and in some parts of Scotland
still is, little difference as regards working on the Sabbath between
fishing and damming, the violation of the day—the punishment scarcely
fits the crime—involved their metamorphosis into apes!<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a></p>

<p>The Koran denies to the faithful on pilgrimage any hunting of game
<i>en route</i>, but allows fishing and eating of fish from the sea.<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a>
At first, eating of fish was apparently unlawful, because the name of
Allah could not always be pronounced over them before they died.</p>

<p>To remedy this enforced abstinence from such a wealth of healthy food
Mahomet blessed a knife and cast it into the sea, thus all fish were
blessed and had their throats cut before they were brought to shore.
“The large openings behind the gills are of course the wounds thus
miraculously made without killing the fish!”<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a></p>

<p>We discover in another legend that an accidental act on the part
of Abraham—not a designed ceremony on the part of Mahomet—gave
Mussulmans their liberty of ichthyophagy. The patriarch, after
sacrificing the ram instead of Isaac, threw the knife into a stream and
incidentally struck a fish, whence fishes are the only animals eaten by
Mahometans without their throats being previously cut.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span></p>

<p>The place of fish in the Zodiac has been already noticed. Apparently
the position of the Pisces led Kepler to believe that he had
discovered the means of determining the true year of our Saviour’s
birth. From the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn and Mars in 1604,
the astronomer working backward found that Jupiter and Saturn were
in the constellation of the Pisces (a fish, be it noted, being the
astrological symbol for Judæa) in the latter half of the year of Rome
747, and were joined by Mars in 748. Their first union in the East
awoke the attention of the Magi, told them that the expected time had
come, and bade them set forth for Judæa.</p>

<p>Astronomy has been to archæology a most helpful hand-maiden in
establishing not only this but other dates of ancient, especially of
Assyrian, history.<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a></p>

that Seth, the son of Adam, taught his son to cast a line, and engraved
the mystery of the craft on those pillars of which Masons are supposed
to know so much, or even if the statement that,</p>

<p>could have been verified, how many discussions on the
question—formerly almost as hotly combated as some religious
doctrine—as to what was the first method of fishing would have been
avoided. Alas! an authoritative answer is even yet to seek.</p>

<p>The nature of the “great fish” of Jonah will, I fear, no longer prove
an attractive subject for sermons. Identification of “the beast”
ranging through all the fishes of Ichthyology, from the celebrated
“first, aiblins it was a whale,” down to “nineteenthly” (whose precise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
species I forget), will alas! with the development of the higher
criticism and of comparative mythology hardly draw the tensely
interested congregations of yore.</p>

<p>Tylor points out that at the root of the apologue of Jonah lies the
widely-spread Nature-myth of the sea-monster or dragon, of which
the fight between Tiāmat and Marduk, and of Andromeda and the
sea-monster are analogous developments.<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a></p>

<p>The picture shows that while the whale’s gastric juices had completely
absorbed Jonah’s clothes and curls, they prevailed not, possibly from
callosity of hide, against his body.]</p>

filled his maw with my delicates: he hath cast me out,” and again in
verse 44, “and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has
swallowed up.”</p>

<p>Allusions to mythical dragons occur elsewhere, as in Psalm lxxiv.
13, “Thou breakest the heads of the dragons (or sea-monsters) in the
water.” The curious belief in a dragon or fish that swallows the moon
spreads wide. This draws from Mr. R. C. Thompson<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a>
the comment, “when it is remembered that Jonah was swallowed by the
‘great fish’ for three days (the period of the moon’s disappearance
at the end of the month), the coincidence is well worth considering;
especially as Jonah is the Hebrew word for dove, and it was at Harrān,
the city sacred to the Moon God, that the dove was sacrificed (Al. Nadim, 294).”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span></p>

<p>But whatever the “great fish,” and whatever the story’s derivation, the
whimsical treatment of the prophet’s imprisonment in a poem by the Rev.
Zachary Boyd, Rector of Glasgow University in the seventeenth century,
demands some quotation:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“What house is this? here’s neither coal nor candle;</span>
<span class="i1">Where I no thing but guts of fishes handle;</span>
<span class="i1">The like of this on earth man never saw,</span>
<span class="i1">A living man within a monster’s mawe!”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He then goes on to contrast Noah’s freedom of movement in the ark with
his enforced immobility:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“He and his ark might goe and also come,</span>
<span class="i1">But I sit still in such a straitened roome,</span>

</div></div></div>

<p>I close this, as my other chapters, with a legend which makes fish
directly or indirectly responsible for some historical happening.</p>

<p>It was through a fish (according to the Talmud) that Solomon regained
his kingdom. The King one day, while bathing, confided his signet
ring to one of his many concubines, Amina. Was it her eyes, I wonder,
or those of that Queen, Pharaonic or other (by whose happy influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
Solomon, eschewing evil and cleaving only unto her, was perhaps inspired
to write The Song of Songs), which he likens to <i>the pools of Hesbon</i>?</p>

<p>A devil named Sakhar, the Talmud goes on, coming in the shape of
Solomon, obtained the ring from Amina, and by virtue of its possession
sat on the throne in Solomon’s guise. After forty days the devil flew
away, and threw the ring into the sea. The signet was immediately
swallowed by a fish, which on being caught was given to Solomon. The
ring was found in its stomach, and he, who without its credentials had
been compelled to beg for bread and from his appearance being changed
by the devil had been regarded as a preposterous pretender, “by this
means recovered his kingdom, and taking Sakhar and tying a great stone
to his neck, threw him into the sea of Tiberias.”<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a></p>

<p>In another version<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a>
—very probable because more characteristic of Solomon, in that he
annexes another wife—the King after the loss of his throne became
a cook in the palace of a foreign sovereign, married his master’s
daughter, bought a fish with the ring inside, and so recovered his realm.</p>

<p>In another legend fish play, if not a historical, yet no small part in
connection with a famous historical character.</p>

<p>St. Brandan in his travels encountered Judas Iscariot, whose allotted
punishments at any rate lacked not monotony, for after each spell of
pitch and sulphur he was condemned to sit on a desolate rock in the
frozen regions. To the query as to the purpose of a cloth bandage
worn round the head, Judas made answer that it was an effectual charm
against the ferocious fishes among which he was often doomed to be
thrown, for at its sight they lost their will to bite. He had obtained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
this shield because on earth he had once given a piece of cloth to a
naked beggar, and so, even unto him, a deed of charity was not allowed
by the Almighty to pass without reward.<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a></p>

<p>When, in Matthew Arnold’s poem, “St. Brandan sails the northern main”
and comes across Judas on an iceberg, the fishes occur not, but the
cloth appears:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And in the street a leper sate</span>
<span class="i1">Shivering with fever, naked, old;</span>
<span class="i1">Sand raked his sores from heel to pate,</span>
<span class="i1">The hot wind fevered him five-fold.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">He gazed upon me as I passed</span>
<span class="i1">And murmur’d: Help me or I die!—</span>
<span class="i1">To the poor wretch my cloak I cast,</span>
<span class="i1">Saw him look eased, and hurried by.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>For which act of charity Judas was permitted by the angel every
Christmas night to</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>CHINESE FISHING</h2>
<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XLIII<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">“PLUS UN PAYS PRODUIT DES POISSONS,<br />PLUS IL PRODUIT D’HOMMES”</span></h3></div>
</div>

<p>If the above dictum<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a>
and Williams’s statement that “in no country, except Japan, is so much food derived
from the water,”<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a>
be accurate, modern China should lack not folk nor food. Every method
of fishing obtains in one part of the country or other, and scarce a
sea or stream exists unvexed by some piscatorial implement.</p>

<p>“Fish are killed by the spear, caught with the hook, scraped up by the
dredge, ensnared in traps, and captured by nets: they are decoyed to
jump into boats by painted boards, and frightened into nets by noisy
ones, taken out of the water by lifting nets, and dived in for by
birds, for the cormorant seizes what his owner can not easily reach.”<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a></p>

<p>This description, minus the cormorant but plus leistering, applies
fairly well to Ancient China. Mr. Werner’s great work discloses no
distinct mention of fishing previous to 1122 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, although
the present to a Viceroy of “cuttle fish condiment” apparently implies
it. From that date the Spear, the Net, the Line, the Rod, and divers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
strange devices figure frequently and historically.<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a>
In the earlier centuries covered by this period, if the Line claimed
adherents,<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a>
Nets made of fine bamboo, with bags arranged in front of wooden
stockades planted on the banks of rivers,<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a>
were the general method.<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a></p>

<p>Although the Chinese have produced quite a considerable literature
on Fishing, the path of a writer unversed in their language is, from
the absence of translations, compassed about with many difficulties.
The trail winds dim and Serbonian, even if, as was my good fortune, a
friendly hand holds out now and then a torch to guide his faltering
steps.<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a></p>

<p>The dividing line between the historical and the non-historical in
China does not cut clearly and without breaks. History as distinct
from legend was assumed till recently to begin between 900 and 800
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, but three archæological discoveries
have affected previous chronological conceptions.</p>

<p>1. The inscribed <i>bone</i> fragments (till the advent of paper, <i>c.</i>
100 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, bones, stones, bronzes and tablets
of wood served for <i>papyri</i>) found in Honan apparently carry as far
back as <i>c.</i> 1500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and shed quite
new light on the character of the early Chinese script. Among the
divination tablets I had hoped for some fish omens similar to those of
Assyria, Greece, and Rome, or some trace of the belief still current in
Southern China that certain fish, as the Dolphin in the Mediterranean,
were weather-prophets: but, owing probably to the dry character of the
country of which they are the voice or rather the testament, none
survive.<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a></p>

<p>2. The wooden tablets at Tunhuang along the Great Wall which illumine
social conditions and deal largely with the commissariat of the army.</p>

<p>3. The MSS. at the Caves of the Thousand Buddhas, found about 1907.
Coming from a Buddhist monastery, they give in the main Buddhist texts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
but also (as do the Egyptian <i>Papyri</i>) many quite new excerpts from
lost writers, in addition to accounts, etc.<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a></p>

<p>A goodly store of stories and descriptions of prehistoric Fishing and
Fishers exists in ancient and modern works.</p>

<p>The statement that “Fishermen used the silk from the cocoon for their
lines, a piece of sharpened iron for their hook, thorn-stick for their
rod, and split grain for their bait”<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a>
carries us back to an age very early and indefinite. On asking a high
Sinitic authority what was the date of the Emperor in whose reign this
tackle was employed, he rapped out, “Date! What was Adam’s date?”</p>

<p>The use of gut was familiar at any rate about the fourth century
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, judging from the sentence in Lieh Tzǔ:
“By making a line of cocoon silk, a hook of a sharp needle, a rod of a branch
of bramble or dwarf bamboo, and using a grain of cooked rice as bait, one can
catch a whole cartload of fish.”<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a></p>

<p>Angling as a pastime must have secured the Imperial favour in early
ages, as its metaphorical use by Sung Yü, fourth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
indicates. “In the golden age,” he tells us, “the Emperors were fishers
of men, using sages as their rod, the true doctrine as their line,
charity of heart and duty to one’s neighbour as their bait, the world
being their fishing ground, and the people their fishes.”</p>

<p>Strolling down the lane of Time, we meet (<i>c.</i> 1122 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>)
with Chiang Tzǔ-ya, the first statesman to recognise the importance of
fishing, and its allied industry, the manufacture of salt.<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span></p>

<p>The tale—not of Chiang’s rise from a very lowly station to governance
of a great Empire, for history furnishes many parallels—but of his
Angling is morally edifying, piscatorially instructive, and is possibly
responsible for the rise in Great Britain and America of the barbless
school of anglers. As yet its pupils, despite the missionary zeal of
Mr. Rhead, are scattered few and far between. The limitation of their
numbers can doubtless be ascribed to their introspective and becoming
fear lest the “real attraction,” which, according to a Chinese classic,
was in our hero’s case <i>not</i> his straight iron but his innate virtue,
should with them, either from sparsity or lowness of power, lack the
requisite magnetism!</p>

<p>But <i>retournons à nos poissons</i>! King Wên, the founder of the Chou
Dynasty, and one of the great sages—whence, perhaps, his intelligent
annexation of Chiang, for all Anglers <i>ex necessitate</i> are, or should
be, also sages—comes across our hero fishing with a piece of straight
iron instead of a barbed hook. This tackle, he explains to the
unrecognised monarch, is based on principles dear to our Conscientious
Objectors, viz. voluntaryism—“for only volunteers would suffer
themselves to be caught thuswise”—and of mercy—“since it gave all
those who wished a chance of escape.”</p>

<p>Wên, from his many campaigns, observed much and missed little. He
noticed the full creel. Thence, as a Sage would, deduced that since a
virtuous man’s wants are always satisfied, Chiang must be just such
a man. He felt instinctively that here indeed was the statesman whom
his grandsire—observe the ancestor-reverence!—would have selected.
So without more ado or any references as to character, Wên carried
Chiang off, whether with or without the full creel history deigns
no word, to his palace, installed him as Viceroy, and ever after
termed him “my Grandfather’s Desire,” a sobriquet which, however well
meant, our philosophic <i>piscator</i>—he was only eighty when caught
straight-ironing—must at times have resented.<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a></p>

<p>Not dissimilar in method if unlike in emolument, stands out the
historical (for he shone in the eighth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) Chang
Chih-ho, that “glittering example of humorous romantic detachment and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
carelessness of public opinion, who spent his time in angling, but used
no baits, as his object was not to catch fish.”<a name="FNanchor_1108_1108" id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a></p>

<p>But the greatest Sage of them all, Confucius, whose philosophy has for
2400 years permeated, perhaps even dominated, public polity and private
action, was not as one of these. Humane, practical, and a sportsman,
“The Master angled, but did not use a net: he shot, but not at birds
perching,” which Legge<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a>
in a note kindly expands into “Confucius would only destroy what
life was necessary to him!” Since netting in his era (<i>c.</i> 500 <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span>), as now, held the field, or rather the
water, the touch of the philosopher’s sole device being the rod implies
a compliment, confirmed by the context, to his humane sportsmanship.</p>

<p>To Mr. Yen’s statement as to the importance of fish, marine or
fresh-water, as a staple of subsistence in China can be added the
evidence as regards ancient times collated by Werner,<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a>
later times by Du Halde,<a name="FNanchor_1111_1111" id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a>
and modern times by Williams,<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a>
Gray,<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a>
and Dabry de Thiersant.<a name="FNanchor_1114_1114" id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a>
While they agree with the rest of the world in the economic necessity
of fisheries, the people, and especially the epicures of China, differ
profoundly from the European or American in ichthyic appreciation.</p>

<p>As the Greeks and Latins at times saw not eye to eye as to the palatal
primacy of certain fishes, the people of the Middle Kingdom eat not,
and never ate, tooth to tooth with those of the West. To the Sinitic
opsophagist <i>his</i> salmon, indeed most of the deep sea fishes, appeals
not at all.</p>

<p>“We delight,” says Mr. Yen, “in eating those of the finny tribe whose
meat is soft and fine, and they are caught for the most part in rivers,
brooks, lakes, ponds, and the surface of the ocean. On the other hand,
there are products of the sea which are regarded by us as delicacies of
the table, but which have little or no consumption in the West. Just to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
mention a few well-known ones, the fins of the shark,<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a>
the bêche-de-mer, the cuttlefish, the jellyfish, and the scollop form
important articles of domestic commerce, but are not bought or sold to
any extent in the West.”<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a></p>

<p>The cuttlefish as a dining delicacy appealed to very early palates.
<i>The Records of Chou</i> recount that on the appointment of Yi Yin to
Viceroyalty, T’ang “bestowed—could he do more?—on him cuttlefish
condiment.”<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a></p>

<p>In China, as elsewhere, the priority of fishing implement furnishes
a problem not easy of solution. Professor Giles’s statement that
“it is clear the net preceded the hook” demands for its gainsaying
a knowledge equal, if possible, to his, and, in addition, more than
triple brass. Mr. Yen, in his “our ancient classics refer to a time
when our primitive ancestors tied ropes together to form fishing nets,”
seemingly confirms Giles. Legge is uncommittal: “they fished with the
line, but the ordinary method was with the net.”<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a></p>

<p>Search in the great Chinese Encyclopædia endorses the precedence of the
Net over the Rod, but not by overwhelming length of time. Its first
reference to the former comes from the <i>I Ching or Book of Changes</i>,
which may date from the eleventh century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>; to the latter
from the <i>Shih Ching</i> or <i>Book of Odes</i>, which apparently ranges from
the eleventh to the seventh century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>This last passage runs—“What are used in Angling? Silk threads formed
into lines. The son of the reverent Marquis and the grand-daughter of
tranquil King.” The startling identification of the silk threads with
a son of a reverent Marquis and a grand-daughter of a King of Peace
(according to another translation) shows that in the matter and measure
of his metaphors in the millennium preceding the Christian era the
Turanian was far from played out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately our <i>deus ex machina</i> Prof. Legge again comes to our aid
by his assurance that “the allusion to silk threads twisted into
fishing lines would seem simply to be to the marriage of the princess
and the young noble—<i>not</i> to the lady’s holding fast of wifely
ways to complete the virtues of reverence and harmony.”<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a>
Another interpretation—“the metaphor indicates that the union of man
and wife, like the silk twisted into fishing lines, is a lasting
one”—recks not of post-war divorce courts, or post-war tackle.</p>

<p>The next reference in the <i>Shih Ching</i> strikes a sad note. Unless we
knew that it was not the grand-daughter of the peaceful King, we might
almost fancy we hear the heroine of the silk-line boast bewailing her
virginal home.</p>

<p>“With your long and tapering<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a>
bamboo rods you angle in the Ch’i” (a river in Honan). “How should I
not think of you? But I am too far away to reach you. When a maiden
leaves her home to be married, her parents and brethren are left
behind. Calmly flows the current of the Ch’i. There are oars of cypress
and boats of pine. Would that I might drive thither and rid me of my sorrow.”</p>

<p>The third reference strikes also a note of sadness, caused now by the
absence of a husband. “When he went a-hunting, I put the bow in the
case for him. When he went a-fishing, I arranged his line for him. What
did he take in Angling? Bream and tench—bream and tench, while the
people looked on to see.”<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a></p>

<p>Angling appears in the <i>Mu t’ien tzǔ chuan</i>, a work assigned to the
tenth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, but probably of much later date. “The pith
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
of the <i>ti</i>, tied half-way up the fishing-line,” about 500
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> took the place of our modern float: the moment the Angler
“saw it sink, he knew a fish was on.”<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a></p>

<p>In the first century before and after the Christian era the germ of
Imperial ostentation and extravagance in tackle raged virulently.
Spreading, if not from China to Peru, at any rate like silk<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a>
from China to Rome, it claimed among its victims the Emperor Nero and the
Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty. The bacillus found the better host in
Nero, who<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a>
fished with golden nets drawn by purple ropes, while his brother of
Asia confined himself to angling from a boat with a hook of pure gold,
a line of white silk, and red carp for a lure.<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a></p>

<p>But the commonality of one State, at any rate, ran no bad second to
the Imperial pair. “The people of Lu,” we read, “were fond of fishing:
they used cinnamon bark for bait, forged <i>gold</i> for hooks, which were
variegated with silver or green colours, while their fishing line
was ornamented with the feathers of the turquoise kingfisher.”<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a>
Here perhaps, as the bird lives on fish, we can detect a conscious or
unconscious touch of homœopathic magic.</p>

<p>Lures such as the natural or artificial fly obtain no record: even now
the Chinese and Japanese try most things before an artificial fly. The
baits consisted of worms, grain, fish, meat, and cassia. The latter
aromatic herb recalls the anglers of Oppian and Pliny, who believed in
the attraction of fish by the sense of smell.<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a></p>

<p>In their unusual baits our authors suggest their <i>confrères</i> of Greece
and Rome. Thus in size of prey, and similarity of bait, the author of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
the <i>K’ung ts’ung tzǔ</i> and Herodotus coincide. As the former lived not
two centuries later than the Father of History, the tip had possibly
just reached China from Egypt—“from Africa comes ever something
new”—viz. the chine of a porker for a crocodile.</p>

<p>The story runs that Tzǔ-ssǔ, a grandson of Confucius, witnessed the
landing from the Yellow River of a fish “as big as a cart.” The
fishermen had baited first with bream, but as the monster, like the
law, <i>de minimis non curavit</i>, they substituted half a sucking pig with
instantaneous success.</p>

<p>But the bait handed down to us by Chuang Tzǔ (fourth century
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), if it faintly recall, completely eclipses “the lungs of
a wild bull,” which Ælian recommended for the capture of the Silurus,
in that it was no less an one than “fifty whole oxen!”<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a></p>

<p>As a producer and as a user of Nets, China ranked and ranks perhaps
higher than any country. The number and variety of Nets in Julius
Pollux can well be matched, while the Oppianic opulence of</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A thousand names a fisher might rehearse</span>
<span class="i1">Of Nets, intractable in smoother verse,”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>meets its peer, if not its superior in Scarth, Gray, or Dabry de
Thiersant,<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a>
who devotes thirty-five pages to what Plutarch terms these
“engines of encirclement.”</p>

<p>If the Net proper, the barrage, and the fish fence sprang from the
same parent,<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a>
then in China the fish fences of bamboo, erected for catching and spawning
purposes, should be included in the term Net.<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a></p>

<p>If this be the case, the Chinese stand out as experts both in the
diversity and the ingenuity of their devices. Passages from old Chinese
authors justify this appreciation.<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a>
They are too numerous for quotation here, but three or four seem worthy of notice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Chronicles of the Elders of Hsiang Yang</i> set forth that the
villages, when forbidden to catch the fine bream of the Han river,
achieved their purpose by erecting a fence, probably of the same nature
as that which in Lu Kuei-mêng’s <i>History</i> is called <i>Wei hsiao</i>—“which
name was taken from the kind of fence used to catch crabs.”</p>

<p>The <i>Shan t’ang ṡsu K’ao</i> describe the <i>mêng sou</i> as a basket net,
plaited of small bamboos: “The cover of its mouth was woven of bamboo
splints: to it hairy and bristling bamboos were fixed: it gradually
decreased in size from the mouth to the junction with the hairy and
bristling bamboos (elsewhere, bamboos with whiskers) so preventing the
fish from going out after they had got in.”</p>

<p>From the same source we learn that the <i>mêng chou</i> resembled in shape
a sieve. When the water became cold, the fish hid in it.<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a>
It was used for fishing, but how it, the <i>ch’u kuo</i>, or the <i>chao</i> were
used or found useful, deponent maketh not clear. But the <i>hung</i>, a sort
of bamboo dam, holds the record. With but one of these the people of
Ch’ien T’ang obtained during the Chin Dynasty a million fish a year,
whence the name <i>Wan chiang hung</i>, or “the million-worker
dam.”<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a>
<i>The Odes</i> of Lu Kuei-mêng tell of a bamboo fence 10,000 feet or about 2
miles long.<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a></p>

<p>We read in the <i>Kuang chou</i> of baiting the nets with the whites of
eggs. In the <i>Ko Kai</i> we encounter a method and a net, both of which
to me, at any rate, are new and may be unique. The <i>San ts’ai t’u hui</i>
states the <i>ko kai</i> was the net commonly called the <i>kai-ou</i>—literally
“striking net.” It was an implement for taking fish out of a larger
net. The <i>kai-tou</i> was brought down with force on to the larger net
near the fish, which thus were made to rebound into it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
But the device, which the <i>Ching chih ch’i wu lei</i> describes and
gravely explains, must act as the limit at once of our wonder and of
our space. “Fishermen (we are told) used to put the hair of small
monkeys on the four corners of their nets, by which means they
succeeded in taking large numbers. It is said that the fish seeing the
hair were attracted towards it, as a man to embroidery!”<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a></p>

<p>The infrequent mention of what was probably the oldest fishing
implement of Palæolithic man, the Spear, admits of no satisfactory
explanation. For some reason the Chinese seem to have employed the
Spear-harpoon but rarely.</p>

<p>Pictures of fishing in <i>T’u shu Encyclopædia</i> (extracted from a work
of the sixteenth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>) confirm this view. If numbers
be any test, the Spear found least favour—it is represented but
once—while the Rod appears four, and the Net seventeen times.</p>

<p>Lu Kuei-mêng, the Izaak Walton of China, in his book of the ninth
century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, does, it is true, include spearing (<i>ch’ai
yü</i>) with a four-pronged weapon among other fishing methods, such as
shooting with bow and arrow (<i>shê ch’ien</i>) and driving into shallow
water with the aid of a wooden rattle (<i>ming lang</i>) for stockade
work. A curious variation of the spear-harpoon (<i>hsien</i>) was an iron
instrument having at the end of a bamboo a cock’s spur, which was used
for iguanas.<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a></p>

<p>The Chinese were evidently familiar with our <i>Otter</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a line
carrying hooks at short intervals, and fastened at either end. The <i>Yo
Yang fêng t’u chi</i>, a work of the Han Dynasty (about the time of the
Christian era) expressly states that this method, with the line made
fast across a river between two boats at anchor, accounted for many big
fish.</p>

<p>But enough evidence has, I believe, been adduced to prove that the
Sinitic <i>piscator</i> had little to learn of his craft.</p>

<p>He apparently lacked Oppian’s pantomimic but scarcely aromatic method
of clothing himself in the skin of a she-goat, probably because he
lacked its victim, the salacious <i>Sargus</i>. If he knew not Ælian’s
pneumatic device of capturing the eel by the aid of a sheep’s bowels,
he was no ignoramus of the habits of the <i>Murænidæ</i>, for he watched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
carefully and waited patiently for air-bubbles, like a destroyer
hunting German U-boats, to rise to the surface and betray the fishes’ lair
in the mud, and then plunged home his depth-charge, or rather his bident.</p>

<p>Fishing by cormorant was unique and peculiar to China alone, according
to Mr. Yen, who adds that “in our country it was confined to one
family, the Liu.<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a>
The fishes thus caught, however, are limited to those of small streams,
unpalatable, and eaten only by very poor people.”</p>

<p>Few realise how great is the patience necessary for the training of an
expert cormorant, or how good is the reward. These seemingly altruistic
<i>piscatores</i> are taught to fish an area in flocks, and at a given
signal return to their master with their prey, made unswallowable by
means of a neck-ring. One boatman watches twelve to twenty of the
birds, each one of whom, although hundreds may similarly be hunting the
same water, knows its own master. If one seize a fish too heavy for
him, another comes to its aid, and together they fetch it to the boat.
More generally the ally (not unlike certain nations in history) hustles
the weaker and despoils him of his catch, and of his titbit reward.</p>

<p>The barndoor fowl, whose hospitable warmth and credulity all the
world abuses, usually hatches out the young birds, whose piscatorial
propensities increase and accentuate on a diet of fish hash and eel’s
blood.</p>

<p>A curious and vicarious manner of Indian fishing can be witnessed
on the Brahmaputra. Birds of the cormorant family range themselves
midstream in line, and advance towards a bank, making a prodigious
pother by flapping the water with their wings. The fish, panic-stricken,
flee to the shallows and even throw themselves on land. The birds, still
in close array, pursue and gorge themselves on their penned-in prey.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now enter villagers,” who as soon as feeding ceases, rush to the
bank and by drums, gongs, and every conceivable noise frighten the
cormorants. Heavy from over-repletion, they have, before they can fly,
to lighten themselves of most of their meal, which in due time provides
the peasants’ supper! This method, if it does not appeal to the palate,
possesses the merit of semi-poetic and retributive justice.<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a></p>

<p>De Thiersant’s assertion that to the Chinese belongs the honour of
being the first to invent <i>pisciculture</i> can only be allowed to pass,
if the term be restricted to hatching out by natural means, bringing
up, and caring for young fish. From this, pisciculture proper differs
as chalk from cheese. Originated by Rémy in the last century, it
consists of artificial fecundation by the extrusion and mixture of
the milt of the male and of the eggs of the female, the hatching out
of the eggs on specially constructed trays of wire, etc., set in
running water, and the nurture of the fry on specially adapted food in
carefully prepared and graduated ponds.</p>

<p>De Thiersant himself, a few pages later,<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a>
makes the point clear. Chinese fish-breeders do not resort to
artificial fecundation, with which they were even in 1870 very
faintly acquainted, for several reasons, not least of which was their
contention that fish thus produced were predisposed to quick
deterioration.<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a></p>

<p>The Chinese (like the Roman) method of fish-breeding in the eighteenth
century,<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a>
and till 1872, consisted in gathering from collecting fences constructed for
the purpose<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a>
eggs which had been fertilised <i>naturally</i>. These were carried
(sometimes hundreds of miles, for the secret of safe transportation
had early been mastered) to ponds or streams for natural, not artificial
hatching. The young fry were guarded carefully, and fed most watchfully.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span></p>

<p>Gray<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a>
enumerates some of the many and minute precautions as to shelter and
food. Rockeries were erected in the ponds to shelter the alevin from
the sun. Bananas were planted on the sides and banks, because the
rain which falls from their leaves during a shower promoted health.
Forbidden, however, were all pigeons, whose dung was held hurtful, and
also (contrary to our experience of the haunt of many and good fish)
all willows, whose leaves were deemed inimical to the growth, even to
the life of the fry.</p>

<p>“The earliest pisciculturist of ancient China,” states Mr. Yen, “was
T’ao Chu-kung,<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a>
who lived in the fifth century B.C. His method of fish culture combined
both knowledge and ignorance. He dug a pond of the size of an acre,
leaving nine small islands scattered about it. In one pond he placed
twenty female carp, three feet in length, and four males of similar
size. This was done in the month of March. Exactly one year later,
there were 5000 fishes one foot long, 10,000 two feet long, and 15,000
three feet long. In the third year the number had multiplied ten or
twenty times, in the fourth year it was not possible to keep count.”</p>

<p>While congratulating T’ao on the nimbleness of his enumerators and
his success, and haggling not at the numbers (for the <i>Cypridæ</i> breed
prolifically), both the disparity in growth and the similarity of the
exactly graded variations in size of these, all yearling, fish are
unto the practical pisciculturist a stumbling-block, which neither
cannibalism nor luck of food can displace.</p>

<p>But to return to T’ao, or rather to his islands. “The nine islands
were to deceive the fishes, who would believe that they were in the
big ocean, travelling round the nine continents.” We may complacently
smile at these fancies, but at any rate let us humbly recall the 2300
years we took to solve the problem of the generation of eels, and
the fantastic theories propounded by Aristotle, by Izaak Walton, and
others, some of which, <i>e.g.</i> the Cairncross, read as ludicrous as
T’ao’s “Happy Isles.”<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span></p>

<p>Fan Li apparently was the first to practise fish breeding not only
in China, but in the world.<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a>
Living in the early fifth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
he antedates the Roman Varro, our earliest authority, by some
three hundred years. He not only bred, but wrote about fish. But
to brother-breeder and brother-writer of the present century like
myself, the process as set forth in his <i>Yang Yü Ching</i> (<i>Treatise on
Fish-breeding</i>), is not only difficult to follow in detail, but sadly
lacking in result.</p>

<p>As an example, take his method with the bastard carp, or <i>Carassius
pekinensis</i>. “In order to breed from the <i>chi</i> fish, it is ripped up
with a bamboo knife, and small quantities of quicksilver, mixed with
river sediment, and <i>yu-ts’ai</i> are introduced into the belly. The
fish is then stuffed with cabbage leaves, and hung up for forty-nine
days” (note here, the time is pre-ordained, and alters not, as with us
nowadays, with changes in the temperature of the water flowing over the
eggs) “in an empty place, after which river water is used to extract
one or two eggs from the belly. These are placed in water, and covered
up with something, and after a while each egg turns into a fish.”</p>

<p>Such ingenious industry, coupled with no small expenditure on
quicksilver, <i>yu-ts’ai</i>, and cabbage, deserved a far better return. Had
Fan Li intelligently anticipated a method in vogue among his countrymen
some two and a half millennia later, money, labour, time, would all
have been saved. But as Rome was not built in a day, so centuries were
necessary for the evolution of a method of fish-hatching absolutely (to
me) unique.</p>

<p>“Not once or twice in its rough” world’s story must the ample, yet
guileless, bosom of the domestic hen have swelled with anticipatory
pride, and subsequent resentful curiosity, as the results of her
“watchful waiting” emerged in guise of ugly ducklings, swans, or
cormorants.</p>

<p>But of all the sittings to borrow her body’s warmth, the strangest and
the most incongruous—after all, the ducklings were terrestrial, of a
kith akin to her, and not aquatic and unregistered aliens—was that
composed of hundreds of <i>fish</i> eggs!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span></p>

<p>Lest this last sentence seem to label me as a descendant of “the first
pre-Pelasgian piscator” from whom, in Sir O. Seaman’s witty verse,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“From whom have sprung (I own a bias</span>
<span class="i1">To ways the cult of rod and fly has)</span>
<span class="i1">All fishermen—and Ananias!”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>or lest it seem to disqualify me for the character bestowed by
Alciphron on an angler, of being one “who would never even slip
into misrepresentation,” I call no less a witness than Mr. S. Wells
Williams, LL.D., late Professor of the Chinese Language and Literature
at Yale College, and author of <i>Tonic and Syllabic Dictionaries of the
Chinese Language</i>.</p>

<p>From page 349 come <i>ipsissima verba</i>:<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a>
“The <i>Bulletin Universel</i> for 1829 asserts that in some parts of China
spawn is carefully placed in an empty egg-shell, and the hole closed:
the egg is then replaced in the nest and after the hen has sat a few
days upon it reopened, and then placed in vessels of water warmed in
the sun, where it soon hatches!”</p>

<p>De Thiersant, in his assertion that “from time immemorial it has been
the policy of the Government and officials to protect fishing in
every way,” and Mr. Yen in his that “our ancient classics mention the
appointment, several centuries before the Christian era, of special
officials to rule over and protect our fishermen,” indicate that a
Board of Fisheries came into existence at an early date.</p>

<p>The <i>Chou Li</i>, or <i>The Rites of the Chou Dynasty</i> (<i>c.</i> 1000
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) point distinctly to wardens being appointed for fishing
purposes. We read, in fact, of an official staff, called <i>Fishermen
attached to the Imperial Court</i>: “They were entrusted with the fishing
appropriate to each season, and made dams for catching fish.”</p>

<p>Private fisheries, with some few exceptions such as the Imperial
preserves, apparently were not allowed, or seem not to have existed.
All waters were free and open to all citizens of ancient China. In
modern times fishing belongs to the State, and licenses to fish,
which are strictly limited in each canton, are obligatory. District
magistrates are bound to care for and police the rivers: to put down
fry in suitable streams: to enforce the laws, especially those dealing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
with a close time, and to permit no cutting of weeds in the waters
during the spawning season.<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a></p>

<p>The Emperors, especially the earlier Emperors, were keen all-round
sportsmen,<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a>
but especially zealous disciples of the craft of Angling. Like all
good fishermen, they rejoiced in having themselves or sharing with
their friends a good day. Sometimes their keen hospitality made them
entirely forget, or turn a blind eye on their own ordinances. Even fear
of the wardens attached to the Imperial Court, to whom was entrusted
(according to the <i>Chou Li</i>) “the fishing appropriate to each season,”
served not at times to stay their ardour.</p>

<p>Fortunately they were saved from themselves and from breaches of the
law, as Mr. Werner shows in a sentence, which in manner and “superior
man” strangely recalls <i>Sandford and Merton</i>, and Mr. Barlow. “It
appears from edifying anecdotes that the pleasures of the chase, etc.,
were a snare to the Chinese monarchs, but they were seldom left without
some superior man to keep before them the moral ideas of earlier days.”</p>

<p>That such was the case some 3000 years ago the story of one of the Chou
Dynasty demonstrates. He was anxious in the extreme to go a-fishing
with the Empress. None of his courtiers and none of his laws could
deter him, although it was the fourth moon, when fish are spawning.</p>

<p>At last his great minister, Tchang-sy-pe, flung himself at the Imperial
feet, implored him not to violate one of the most essential laws of
the realm, and so set an example which, if followed generally, would
destroy one of “the commonest and amplest staples of food.” The
“superior man” succeeded. The Emperor, struck by Tchang’s reasoning,
and perhaps by the enormity of his wrong-doing, immediately called the
party off.</p>

<p>Another “superior man” later on saves the situation, and his monarch,
also one of the Chou Dynasty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span></p>

<p>This time we have no excuse of hospitality, no fair Empress before
whose eyes our angler, as Antony with Cleopatra, wanted to display his
prowess, or a new cast. No! he was “merely amusing himself”—think of
the crime!—“by fishing in one of the Palace lakes.”</p>

<p>But alas! ’twas the fifth moon, when fishes were still busy breeding
the nation’s common and ample staple of food. The line raised for a
fresh throw was suddenly cut by the Viceroy, Ly-Ke. “What the deuce are
you doing?” thundered the Emperor, aghast at the audacity of the act.
“My duty,” quietly answered Ly-Ke. “All must obey the laws which you
have bidden me enforce.”</p>

<p>The voice is the voice of Ly-Ke, but the sentence and sentiment smack
of Mr. Barlow! Such, however, is the power of the “superior man,” that
the contrite autocrat not only bestowed a present on the intrepid
Atropos who shore his line, but commanded that its severed bits should
hang for all to see in the ante-chamber of the Palace, as a warning to
future ages.<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a></p>

<p>Whether in ancient China a fish-god, such as Ebisu in Japan,<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a>
or fish-gods existed, I have not ascertained, but in our day the fishermen
on the southern coasts celebrate in spring or autumn a festival to
propitiate the gods of the waters. An immense display of lanterns
lights the path for a huge dragon, made out of slender bamboo frames
covered with strips of coloured cotton or silk: the extremities
represent his gaping head and frisking tail. The monster, symbolising
the ruler of the watery deep, is preceded by huge models of fish
gorgeously illuminated.<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span></p>

<p>But whether the Sinitic Pantheon lacked or held a deity of fishermen,
it was reserved for Hsü, the hero of one of the stories in <i>Liao Chai
Chih I</i>, to summon from the vasty deep and hold in willing peonage a
piscatorial power all his own.<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a></p>

<p>This <i>djin</i> of the water was both recognisant and static—no twelve-day
banquets speeded <i>him</i> to Æthiopia—and far more instant in service
than Hermes or Aphrodite, as Heliodorus and other epigrammatists
plainly prove. Not infrequent must have been the occasions when Greek
and Roman fishermen returning, despite their sacrificial offerings,
with empty creels, met the taunt,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“They’re gods: perchance they sleep,</span>
<span class="i1">Cry out, and know what prayers are worth,</span>
<span class="i18">Thou dust and earth.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Had the fishermen of the Dodekanese and of Italy, following the example
of Hsü, poured oblations of the wine of the islands, or deprompted the
old Falernian, perhaps the deities of their craft, who oft-times must
have jibbed at repeated hecatombs of fish, even if “spiced,” and at the
sight of the Olympian box-rooms littered with cobbled cobbles and torn
tackle, would have been more regular in attendance and more prompt in aid.</p>

<p>The story runs that “every night, when Hsü fared forth to fish, he
would carry some wine with him, and drink and fish by turns, always
taking care to pour out a libation on the ground, accompanied by the
invocation, ‘Drink, too, ye drowned spirits of the River!’ Such was
his regular custom: and it was noticeable that, even on occasions when
others caught naught, he always got a full basket.”</p>

<p>The means by which this success was attained and other pleasant details
are set forth fully in that delightful book by Professor Giles,
<i>Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a> Suffice it, however, here
to recount that one drowned Spirit of the River, the genius of Hsü’s
beat, touched, perhaps even affected, by the alcoholic libation, at
first invisibly, afterwards openly glided down stream, quietly drove
the lower reaches, and shepherded the fishes towards our angler’s bait.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p>

<p>Like his Chinese brother, the British angler, when he goes a-fishing,
carries a flask: unlike him, he does not, and cannot, unless he have
the grand accommodation of a Loch Leven boatman thirty years ago,
“drink and fish by equal turns.” Even if the difficulty of equal
drinking turn by turn on the part of the sportsman and sprite be
overcome, it is doubtful whether a British angler, however adaptive and
alert to learn, can in these days ensure a full creel by adopting Hsü’s
tip, having regard to the scanty stock and prohibitive price of whisky.
Whether in the near or even far future the recipe can be thoroughly
tested lies on the niggard lap of the Board of Control.

the legends of China, for <i>c.</i> 1500 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>

Cf. Dr. J. T. Jehu’s <i>Lectures before the Royal Society</i>, 1919. It is
noteworthy that whatever be the geological date of Man, the oldest
true fish, as we understand the term, seems the Shark family, which,
although extremely archaic, has but little altered. Next in seniority
comes probably the <i>Ceradotus</i>; if now “merely a living fossil” and
found only in Queensland, its form, hardly modified, corresponds with
remains found all over the world as early as from the Trias.</p></div>

Dr. Turrell, the author of that researchful book, <i>Ancient Angling
Authors</i>, London, 1910, while of opinion that the “wheele” was in the
course of time evolved from the “wind” of the troller, differentiates
between their uses in fishing. Barker “put in a wind to turn with a
barrell, to gather up his line and loose at his pleasure: this was his
manner of trouling.” Walton’s words are, “a line of wire through which
the line may run to as great a length as is needful when (the fish is)
hook’d and for that end some use a wheele,” etc. The use of the “wind”
as described by Barker in his first edition was simply to gather up the
slack line in working the bait, “this was the manner of his trouling”;
while that of Walton’s “wheele” was to let the line go, in playing the
rushes of salmon, of which his experience seems mainly vicarious.</p>

<p>Sea-anglers of the present day prefer in many cases man-handling
the line to using the reel: thus the Spanish fisherman on striking
a tunny throws the whole Rod back into the boat, the crew of which
seize the line (which is of great thickness) and haul the fish in by
sheer brute force. (See <i>The Rod on the Rivieras</i> (1911), p. 232.)</p></div>

The Neolithic stage, some hold, is characterised by
the presence of polished stone implements and in particular the
stone <i>axe</i>, which, judging from its perforation, so as to be more
effectually fastened to a wooden handle, was probably used rather for
wood than conflict. T. Peisker, <i>Cambridge Mediæval History</i>, 1911,
vol. i., has much of interest on the domestication of this period.</p></div>

Montezuma’s table was provided with fish from the Gulf of Mexico
brought to the capital within twenty-four hours of capture by means
of relays of runners. Some five gods of fishing, of whom the chief
seems to have been Opochtli, were worshipped: to him was ascribed the
invention of the net and the <i>minacachalli</i> or trident. Cf. de Sahagun,
<i>Histoire générale des choses de la Nouvelle Espagne</i>, traduite et
annotée par D. Jourdanet et Rémi Simeon, p. 36, Paris, 1880. De
Sahagun, a Franciscan, came to Mexico in 1529 and died there in 1590.

after a portion had been set aside for the feudal lord, the rest of the
catch was divided in fixed shares; see Joyce, p. 300.</p></div>

Fishermen in Malay, <i>while they are at sea</i>, studiously avoid
mentioning the names of birds or beasts: all animals are called
“cheweh,” a meaningless word, which is believed not to be understood
by the creatures (J. G. Frazer, <i>The Golden Bough</i>, second edition,
1900, vol. i. p. 460). So, too, fishermen from some villages on the
N.E. coast of Scotland never pronounce, <i>while at sea</i>, under penalty
of poor catches, certain words such as “minister,” “salmon,” “trout,”
“swine,” etc. The first, poor fellow! “que diable allait-il faire dans
cette galère?” is invariably referred to as “the man with the black

well suited, for fishing. Another example with meshes two inches
wide, probably formed part of a hunting net. R. Munro, <i>The Lake

<i>Reliquiæ Aquitanicæ</i> (London, 1875), ii. p. 58. Christy’s solitary
buttress for his opinion is a reference to “a Nootka Sound fishing
implement,” which is identical (according to Rau, fig. 9) with a hook
described in Mr. J. G. Swan’s <i>The Indians of Cape Flattery</i>, as used
by the Makahs solely (and successfully) for the halibut, because “its
mouth is vertical, instead of horizontal, like most fish.” The absence

If both the ends of the gorge were as much bent up as a hook, the
tendency would be for the gorge, when its points got fast, to be
rotated by the pull on the line and to assume, owing to greater
curvature, a bent-back position, which would allow of its easy
withdrawal and defeat the object—the capture of the fish. Some Santa
Cruz gorges are of an angular type, but with the points turned somewhat
down. The double hook of bronze or copper, <i>e.g.</i> of Ancient Peru,
seems to support my suggestion of gorge evolution, although, fair to
add, it was suspended from the centre.</p></div>

Sanchouniathon, as translated by Philo of Byblus, <i>ap.</i> Euseb., <i>Praep.
Ev.</i> i. 10, 9, in what purports to be a Phœnician account, would bring
the invention right down to the Iron Age. “Many generations later
Agreus and Halieus sprang from the stock of Hypsouranios. They were the
discoverers of hunting and fishing, hunters and fishers being called
after them. From these in turn sprang two brothers, inventors of iron
and iron-working. One of these brothers, Chrysor, practised spells and
charms and oracles. He is Hephaistos, and he it is who invented hook
and bait and line and boat, being the first of all men to set sail.
Wherefore also they worshipped him as a god after his death, and named
him Zeus Meilíchios.”</p></div>

H. T. Sheringham holds that both early and recent specimens of Fijian
hooks bear out this view (<i>Ency. Brit.</i>, ed. xi., <i>s.v.</i> “Angling”).
“The progressive order of hooks used by the Indians or their
predecessors in title in North America was, after the simple device of
attaching the bait to the end of a fibrous line, (1) a gorge, a spike
of wood or bone, sharpened at both ends and fastened at its middle to
a line; (2) a spike set obliquely in the end of a pliant shaft; (3) a
plain hook; (4) a barbed hook; (5) a barbed hook combined with sinker
and lure. This series does not exactly represent stages of invention:
the evolution may have been affected by the habits of the different
species of fish or their increasing wariness. The above progressive
order applies, I believe, on the whole all over the world, if due
allowance be made for varying conditions” (<i>Smithsonian Handbook of
American Indians</i> (Washington), p. 460).</p></div>

on his voyage in N.W. American waters (see Ethnographical Coll. at

My own Mohave Rod is of <i>’ihora</i>, the red willow of that
district, barked and straightened by an ingenious Indian method. The
line is of the prepared bast of <i>’ido</i>, another species of willow,
and the hook of barrel cactus thorn. Hooks made out of <i>Echinocactus
wislizeni</i> are better adapted for fish which do not nibble at the
bait, but bolt it hook and all; for this reason the Indians fasten
the bait <i>below</i> the hook (E. Palmer, “Fish-hooks of the Mohave
Indians,” <i>American Naturalist</i>, vol. xii. p. 403). On the north-west
coast the Indians a generation ago invariably used spruce-wood for
their halibut hooks (Rau, p. 139). Some Maori hooks are of human bone
and <i>pawa</i>, with <i>kiwi</i> feathers.</p></div>

In <i>Contributions to North American Ethnology</i>, 1877, i. p. 43,
Dall states that the <i>débris</i> of the heaps show tolerably uniform
division into three stages, characterised by the food which formed
the staple of subsistence and by the weapons for obtaining as well
as the utensils for preparing the food. The stages are: 1st, The
Littoral period, represented by the <i>Echinus</i> layer; 2nd, The Fishing
period, represented by the Fish-bone layer; 3rd, The Hunting period,
represented by the Mammalian layer. This antecedence of fishing before
hunting, if Dall be correct, was, I imagine, caused probably by local
or climatic conditions in the Arctic Circle; it is not the general rule elsewhere.</p></div>

“Apes know how to get oysters thrown up on the shore, but man has been
endowed with the knowledge how to get them in and out of the sea.” The

For a similar use of bow and harpoon arrow by the Bororo tribes in the
Amazon valley, see W. A. Cork, <i>Through the Wilderness of Brazil</i>, p.
380. Our gaff, a descendant, possibly, of the unilaterally one-barbed
spear, seems possessed of perpetual youth. The first description of its
use in Angling in England occurs, according to Mr. Marston (<i>Walton
and the Earlier Fishing Writers</i> (1898), p. 97), in T. Barker’s <i>Art
of Angling</i> (1651), but according to Dr. Turrell, <i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 85
and 91, only in Barker’s 2nd of 1657, “a good large landing hook.” From
the definition, however, by Blount, <i>Glossage</i>, in 1657, “<i>Gaffe</i>, an
iron wherewith seamen pull great Fishes into their ships,” its previous
existence and employment at sea can be deduced.</p></div>

There is no hook; only a piece of whalebone or a stem of seaweed, with
a feather stuck at the end, attached to which is a running knot, which
holds the bait. As soon as the fish has swallowed feather and bait, the
women, for the men disdain fishing, draw it to the surface and quickly
seize it. Cf. Darwin, <i>Jour. of Researches, etc., during the Voyage of
H.M.S. Beagle</i> (London, 1860), ch. x, p. 213.</p></div>

the line under the left wing and over the right wing, and about the
bodie as a man weareth his belt; turne the Goose off into a Pond where
Pikes are; there is no doubt of sport with much pleasure betwixt the
Goose and the Pike. It is the greatest pleasure that a noble Gentleman
in Shropshire doth give his friends for entertainment. There is no

For a full description of this method, see <i>Sport on Land and Water</i>,
by F. G. Griswold, privately printed (New York, 1916), and <i>The Game
Fishes of the World</i>, by C. F. Holder (London, 1913). To the kite,
which is of the ordinary 28-inch type, is allowed 700 feet of old
fishing line from off a reel; the fisherman’s line is tied to the kite
about 20 feet from the bait with a piece of cotton twine. When a Tuna
fish takes the bait the cotton line breaks, and the kite is either
reeled in or falls into the sea. The Santa Catalina fishing, with
its records of enormous Tuna, of Sword fish (the largest 463 lbs.),
sometimes fighting for 14 hours, sounding 48 times, and leading the
launch for a distance of 29 miles, and of Giant Bass weighing 493
lbs., fills a British angler with envious despair, a despair which is
heightened when one reads that the regulation tackle prescribed by the
Tuna Club is, or was not long ago, a sixteen ounce Rod and a line not
over No. 24! In Mr. Zane Grey’s enthralling volume (<i>Tales of Fishes</i>
(London, 1919), p. 39) we read of a swordfish, that “when he sounded,
he had pulled thirteen hundred feet off my reel, although we were
chasing him (in a motor boat) full speed all the time”!</p></div>!

<i>The Life of the Salmon</i>, p. xv, London, 1907: “At once the most
primitive and most deadly method of catching fish, which inhabit
rivers, is the erection of built barriers and enclosures.” Plutarch (De
Sol. Anim. 26) has no doubt of the priority of the Line over the Net:
“Fishermen when perceiving that most of the fishes scorned the line and
hook as stale devices or such as can be discovered, betook themselves
to fine force and shut them up with great casting nets, like as the
Persians serve their enemies in their wars”—σαγηνεύειν—(Cf. Herodotus,
vi. 31) “to sweep the whole population off the face of a country”
(Hollands’ Trs.). W. v. Schulenburg, <i>Märkische</i> <i>Fischerei</i> (Berlin,
1903), s. 62, “Das Fischnetz galt also schon in der Vorgeschichtlichen

forests are six feet in diameter, with meshes varying from one inch at
the outside to about one-eighth at the centre. The diligence of the
creatures has been pressed into weaving fishing-nets for the use of man
by setting up, where the webs are thickest, long bamboos bent over in
a loop at the end. On this most convenient frame the spider in a short
time produces a web which resists water as readily as does a duck’s
back, and holds fish up to a pound satisfactorily. See also Robert W.
Williamson (<i>The Maflu Mountain People of British New Guinea</i> (London,
1912), p. 193) who differs materially from Pratt as to the formation of
the net. The illustration is reproduced by the kind permission of <i>The

The representation, reproduced by the kind permission of the Society
for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies, consists of four men carrying
in each hand a fish by the tail. The absence of boots and ornaments is
in keeping with their occupation. The fishes with one exception have
heads like dolphins, similar to the representation of Poseidon with a
tiny dolphin in his hand. The painting is executed in the “black and
red” style upon the usual white slip. The figures are drawn firmly
and boldly according to the conventional scheme, shoulders to front
and legs in profile; the slim proportions of the bodies are common to
many Mycenæan works. The most barbaric features of the drawing are the
absence of hands, and the monstrous eye in the middle of the cheek.
Cf. No. 80 in the <i>British Museum Cat. of Gems</i>, which shows a man
clad with the characteristic Mycenæan loin cloth carrying a fish by a
short line attached to its gullet. <i>Excavations at Phylakopi in Melos</i>

Equally famous, perhaps even more so, is the representation of a fish
found in 1882 near Vettersfelde in Lower Lausitz, but now in Berlin.
It is the shield-sign of a Scythian chief, made in gold <i>repoussé</i>
work early in the fifth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> See

for the <i>Thymus alalonga</i>.</p></div>

“With the division of the people of the Empire into four distinct
classes—scholars, agriculturists, artisans, and merchants—the men and
women who followed the trade of fishing for a livelihood were placed
in an anomalous position from not being included in any of the four
classes. Thus socially ostracised to a certain extent, they clung to
themselves, forming groups or colonies of their own along the coasts
or on isolated islands. They lived in a world of their own, knowing
nothing of the affairs of their country and caring less. To this day
they do not come into direct contact with their countrymen on the
mainland.” Wei-Chung W. Yen: Fourth International Fishing Congress

holds that the view expounded in Leaf’s <i>Troy</i> that the War was an
economic struggle by the Greeks for trade expansion to the fertile
lands of the Euxine and for the extinction of the tolls exacted by the
Trojans is untenable, because (<i>inter alia</i>) of their want of nautical

Subdivided by the waters of the Ægean into innumerable islands, where
the scattered communities could only keep in touch by boat or ship,
Greece naturally became a nursery of seamen. The descriptive and
musical epithets applied to the deep in Greek poetry show how much its
endless variety of surface and colour, its beauty and its majesty,
appealed to the Hellenic imagination. S. H. Butcher, <i>Harvard Lectures</i>
(London, 1904), p. 49, speaks of the Greeks as “born sailors and
traders, who from the dawn of history looked upon the sea as their
natural highway.” Contrast with this Plato, <i>Laws</i>, iv. 705

He never mentions Tyre, the later port. Evans (<i>Scripta Minoa</i>, pp.

or “red men,” are really the “Minoans,” and are to be distinguished
from the Σιδόνιοι or Phœnicians. At what date the latter appeared
in the West Mediterranean is still a matter of controversy, but the

While the early Greeks learned much with regard to navigation from the
Phœnicians, none of the Homeric nautical terms have been traced to a
Phœnician source, as might have been expected in view of the large
number of such terms which the English language has borrowed from the
Dutch, such as <i>ahoy</i>, <i>boom</i>, <i>skipper</i>, <i>sloop</i>, etc. The French has
taken from the English, <i>beaupré</i>, <i>cabine</i>, <i>paquebot</i>, etc. Seymour, p. 322.</p></div>

“The choice of the subjects (in <i>The Shield of Achilles</i>), especially
the absence of mythological subjects, the arrangement of the scenes in
concentric bands, and the peculiar technique, all point to oriental,
<i>i.e.</i> in the main to Phœnician and Assyrian influence. In these
respects the earliest actual Greek work known to us by description,
viz. The Chest of Cypselus (<i>c.</i> 700 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>),
consisting of cedar wood, ivory, and gold, and richly adorned
(according to Pausanias, V. 17) with figures in relief, holds an
intermediate place between <i>The Shield of Achilles</i> and the art of the
classic period. Hence we infer that the Shield belongs to the earlier
time, when (as we also learn from Homer) the Phœnicians were the great
carriers between the Mediterranean countries and the East” (Monro,
<i>Il.</i>, XVIII). Professor Jebb (<i>Homer</i>, p. 66) ranks, in the earlier
period, Phœnician lower than Phrygian influence, but the latest writer
on the subject—F. Poulsen, <i>Der Orient und die frühgriechische Kunst</i>,
Leipzig-Berlin, 1912—makes large claims for the influence of the
Phœnicians in art.</p></div>

The explanation of Athenæus (Bk. I. 16, 22 and 46) is ingenious. Homer
never represents fish or birds, or vegetables, or fruit “as being put
on the table to eat, lest to mention them would seem like praising
gluttony, thinking besides there would be a want of decorum in dwelling
on the preparation of such things, which he considered beneath the
dignity of Gods and Heroes.” The latest explanation—by Professor J. A.
Scott, <i>Class. Journ.</i>; <i>Chicago</i>, 1916-17, p. 329—that “Homer looked
upon fish with great disfavour, because as a native of Asia Minor he
had been trained to regard fish as an unhealthful and distasteful food
to be eaten only as a last resort,” would attain nearer “what seems
the solution of this vexed question” (Scott’s words), if he produced
(1) data establishing Homer’s country of birth, and (2) evidence far
stronger than “Tips to Archæological Travellers” (even though these be
written by Sir Wm. Ramsay) as regards the general “unhealthfulness” of
the fish of Asia Minor.</p></div>

Schrader, <i>Reallexikon</i> (Strassburg, 1901), p. 244, states that in
neither the Avesta nor the Rig-Veda is there any mention of fishing,
nor in the Aryan period were there any common names for fish, and
that throughout the Homeric age, which generally knows fishing as an
existent occupation, there still seems to be a recollection of a time
when the Greek hero ate fish just as little as he rode, wrote, or
cooked soup!</p></div>

It is but fair, however, to add that the Scholiast notes this passage
as the only one in the <i>Iliad</i> where fish is mentioned as a food, while
Monro makes the ingenious comment that these oysters, or shell fish,
are to be regarded not as luxuries, but as a way of satisfying the
hunger of a crew at sea. Of oysters this is the only mention in the
Homeric Poems. As oyster shells and even unopened oyster shells were
found by Dr. Schliemann at Mycenæ, the liking for oysters is not likely
to have been lost between the Mycenæan and the Homeric times. The
remains of the Homeric (sixth) city at Troy yielded very many cockle
shells, but of cockles there seems no mention in the poems.</p>

<p>Numerous representations of fishes are found on Mycenæan and Cretan
works of art.</p></div>

<i>Lectures on Greek Poetry</i>, 67 ff. There are nearly three hundred
comparisons in Homer’s poems; but of detailed similes only some two
hundred and twenty, of which the <i>Odyssey</i> contains but forty. Miss
Clerke (<i>Familiar Studies in Homer</i>, p. 182 ff.) shows that angling is

Among the arguments elaborated by Payne Knight and others to prove
that the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> were written by different authors and
dealt with far different times, one is based on the fact that certain
methods of fowling and fishing are only found in the <i>Odyssey</i>. If this
argument be pushed to its logical end, it should be easy to prove that
the ages of Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, which overlapped, were really
far apart, because, while the latter mentions the familiar use of
tobacco, the former never once alludes to it.</p></div>

See Eustathius <i>ad loc.</i> The spear with which Telegonos wounded
Odysseus was tipped with the κέντρον of a Roach, according to A. G.
Pearson, <i>Fragments of Sophocles</i> (Cambridge, 1917), vol. ii. p.
105 ff., <i>à propos</i> of the lost Ὀδυσσεὺς ἀκανθοπλήξ. Van Leeuwen
(<i>Odyssey</i>, 2nd ed., Leyden, 1917), in his note on xi. 134-7, makes
the fish the sting-ray (<i>radio raiæ pastinacæ</i>), which from its
deadly character (cf. Pliny, <i>N. H.</i>, ix. 67) is to my mind much
more probable, despite Liddell and Scott’s translation of τρυγὼν as
‘<i>roach</i>,’ the absolutely harmless Roach! Cf. Epicharmus, <i>Frag.</i>
66 Kaibel, τρυγὁνες τ’ ὀπισθόκεντροι, and Aristotle, <i>N. H.</i>, ix.

an untimely death at the hands of Phorcys, because of its cannibal
propensities. See Eustathius, <i>Od.</i>, p. 1676, 45, commenting on xi.
133. In <i>The Life of Apollonius of Tyana</i>, vi. 32, Philostratos says
Odysseus was wounded by the αἰχμὴ τῆς τρυγόνος. Van Leeuwen instances
among some old armour preserved at Bergum the weapon of an Indian
pirate, “which is made of the tail of the ray.”</p></div>

There are of course limitations to the “pulley-hauley” of a hand-line;

Later on it is true we do find the Roman “burgher” becoming also an
amateur angler, and gentlefolk, including ladies and children, taking
freely to the sport. <i>Piscator</i> is generally used in reference to those
who were fishermen by trade, whereas <i>venator</i> and <i>auceps</i> may be
likewise applied to mere lovers of hunting and fowling (H. Blümner,

In Victor Bérard’s <i>Les Phéniciens et l’Odyssée</i> (Paris, 1903), vol.
ii. p. 64 ff. (a work, compact of knowledge and of both classical and
modern research, which tracks characters and episodes in Homer to
and compares them with Egyptian and Phœnician accounts), is found a
very interesting dissertation on Proteus, the guardian of the seals
of Poseidon and foreteller of the future (<i>Od.</i>, IV.). Bérard holds
that the name was simply a Greek form of the Egyptian word Prouiti,
or Prouti, which was one of the ascriptions or titles of the kings of
Egypt, as to whose knowledge of or association with magicians (who,
like Proteus, were capable of transforming themselves or other objects)
he cites alike Maspero and the Old Testament. See, however, for other
possibilities, P. Weizsäcker in Roscher, <i>Lex. Myth.</i>, iii. 3172-3178,
who concludes that for us, as for Menelaos or Aristaios, Proteus the
shape-shifter is still a very slippery customer.</p></div>

The Ἀγὼν is found in only a few of the editions of Hesiod. I have
followed the text of C. Goettling, 1843. The author Herodotus, who
wrote probably about 60 to 100 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, lived
of course centuries after Hesiod, who is generally dated some 100 to
200 years subsequent to Homer. The account given by Suidas varies in
several small details, for instance the riddle is rendered in prose as
well as in metre. He definitely states that illness, not the riddle,
was accountable for the poet’s death. </p>

<p>Since writing this Note, I have come across in the Oxford <i>Homer</i>, vol.
v. (1912), edited by T. W. Allen, the Ἀγὼν, the <i>Life of Homer</i> by
Plutarch, and by Suidas, all conveniently placed together. Mr. Allen,
in the <i>Jour. Hell. Studies</i>, XXXV. (1915), 85-99, has an elaborate
article on ‘the Date of Hesiod,’ which for astronomical and other
reasons he now fixes as 846-777 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p></div>

“It is difficult to understand how the author could derive from <i>Works</i>
<i>and Days</i> a reputation like that enjoyed by Hesiod, especially if we
remember that at Thespiæ, to which the village of Ascra, the birthplace
and early home of Hesiod, was subject, agriculture was held degrading
to a freeman” (Smith, <i>Dict. Gk.-Rom. Biog. and Myth.</i>, <i>s. v.</i> “Hesiod”).</p></div>

When Pausanias came to Thespiæ on his Bœotian round, the
representatives of the Corporation who owned the land told him
dogmatically that the <i>Works and Days</i> alone came from the Master’s
hand, and showed him the <i>ne varietur</i> copy on lead, wanting the
proœmium which we read at the head of the poem (Paus., 9. 31. 4).</p></div>

The passage, attributed by Euthydemus (in his <i>Treatise on Pickled
Fish</i>) to Hesiod, which mentions seven fish, does not upset my
statement, because the paternity of the work has long been deemed
spurious. Even Athenæus brands the verses as “the work of some cook,
rather than that of the great accomplished Hesiod,” and concludes from
intrinsic evidence, such as the mention of Byzantium, etc., and the
Campanians, etc., “when Hesiod was many years more ancient than any
of these places or tribes,” that they were written by Euthydemus. See
Athen., III. 84.</p></div>

It suggests itself to me that in the answer to the riddle there is
just possibly a play within a play, or a double latent meaning, for
the word φθεὶρ denotes not only a louse, but also a fish of the Remora
kind. Perhaps this humour is too subtle even for a class so noted for
“calliditas,” or shrewd wit, as Greek fishermen are reputed to have been.</p></div>

From the fish (in old English <i>daulphin</i>) came apparently the title
of the eldest son of the kings of France from 1349 to 1830. According
to Littré the name Dauphin, borne by the lords of the Viennois,
was the proper name <i>Delphinus</i> (the same word as the name of the
fish), whence the province subject to them was called <i>Dauphiné</i>.
Humbert III., on ceding the province, made it a condition that the
title should be perpetuated by being borne by the eldest son of
the French king. A. Brachet, <i>An Etymological Dict. of the French
Language<sup>3</sup></i> (Oxford, 1883), p. 113, states that the
title—peculiar to S. France—first appears in 1140: “the origin is
obscure, though it certainly represents the <i>Delphinus</i>.”</p></div>

In Lapland the “sea-swallows” render great aid in the salmon season.
For some cause these small marine birds elect to follow the inward
and outward course of the fish, and are thus infallible guides to
the fishermen, with whom they become so tame that they will light
on their fingers, and take, if not “the choicest of the spoil,”
scraps of fish. No wonder they are termed “The Luck-bringers.” See

porpoises shepherd the fish: the Egyptian, however, spares to his
helpers their lives, but naught else. The natives of Angola were much
more recognisant of service, as an interesting description by an
old traveller of a fish drive there evidences: “They use upon this
coast to fish with harping irons, and waite upon a great fish which
cometh once a day to feed along the shoare which is like a grampus.
Hee runneth very near the shoare, and driveth great skuls of fish
before him; the negroes runne along and strike their harping irons
about him, and kill great store of fish, and leave them in the sand
till the fish hath done feeding and then they come and gather up the
fish. This fish will many times runne himself aground, but they will
presently shore him off again, which is as much as four or five men
can doe. They call him Emboa, which is in their speech a Dogge: and
will by no means hurt or kill any of them.” <i>The Strange Adventures

B. V. Head, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 266 ff. As an emblem of the sea the dolphin
is very general, from the rude sculpturings of Etruscan sarcophagi,
the later mural adornments at Pompeii, down to the paintings of the
walls of the Vatican by Raphael. In all, the striking dissemblancy
to the actual dolphin of natural history can be remarked at a
glance. In the case of Raphael, however, it must be remembered that
the designs are modelled on the classical decorations which were
discovered in the Baths of Titus, where the Dolphin had been with
propriety introduced as a marine symbol (Moule, <i>Heraldry of Fish</i>,
p. 8).</p></div>

different was the behaviour of the first generation of Man (who
according to Philo’s <i>Translation of Sanchuniathon</i>, quoted by
Eusebius, <i>præp. ev.</i>, I. 9, 5), “consecrated the plants shooting
out of the earth, judged them gods, worshipped them, but yet lived
upon them” (Cf. de Brosses, <i>Culte des Dieux Fétiches</i>). In Plutarch,
<i>Symp.</i>, VIII. 8. 4, Nestor states that “the priests of Poseidon
never eat fish, for Poseidon is called the Generator; and the race
of Hellen sacrificed to him as the first father, imagining, as
likewise did the Syrians, that Man rose from a liquid substance, and
therefore they worship a fish as of the same production and breeding
as themselves, being in this matter more happy in their philosophy
than Anaximander: for he says that fish and men were not produced in
the same substance, but that men were first produced in fishes and,
when they were grown up and able to fend for themselves, were thrown
out and so lived on the land. Therefore, as fire devours its parents,
that is the matter out of which it was first kindled, so Anaximander,
asserting that fish were our common parents, condemneth our feeding
upon them.” The belief in the descent of man from fish exists in
the present day among the Ponapians of the Caroline Islands, and
elsewhere (J. G. Frazer, <i>Folk Lore in the Old Testament</i> (London,
1918), i. 40). As regards the changes in our development which make
the whole world kin, Empedocles, (Καθαρμοί, <i>frag.</i> 117, Diels) sings,</p>

the fear in the case of the loach, of which the Syrian goddess was

Their method was to let down by a rope from the boats blocks of wood
(heavily weighted with lead) to which were attached great spikes
and hooks, which on reaching the bottom were drawn to and fro, with
the result that “here gasping Heads confess the killing Smart, |
There bleeds a Tail, which quivers round the Dart.” Cf. a fragment
from Menander’s <i>The Fisherman</i>, <i>frag.</i> 12 in the <i>Frag. comicor.

Byron’s view of fishing is not favourable—as his lines in <i>Don Juan</i>,
Canto XIII. prove:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“Angling, too, that solitary vice,</span>
<span class="i4">Whatever Isaak Walton says or sings.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He bore, possibly from failure to catch his boyish Aberdeenshire
trout, a grudge against Father Izaak,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“The quaint, old, cruel coxcomb in his gullet</span>
<span class="i4">Should have a hook, and a small trout to pull it.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p> Byron closes his note with “But Anglers! No Angler can be a
good man.” Walton received many a shrewd blow, especially from his
contemporary Richard Franck, whose <i>Northern Memories</i>, with its
appreciation of the Fly and its depreciation of Izaak’s ground-bait,
found less favour than the <i>Compleat Angler</i>. His worsting of Walton
at Stafford runs, “he stop’d his argument and leaves Gesner to defend
it: so huff’d a way.” Again, “he stuffs his book with morals from
Dubravius—not giving us one precedent of his own experiments, except
otherwise when he prefers the trencher to the troling-rod! There are
drones that rob the hive, yet flatter the bees that bring them honey.”</p></div>

Proteus, for Pantagruel (IV. 31) discovers him with his lantern at

lantern has long been coupled with that of the Sea-urchin, but as a
few pages later on we find ourselves in the <i>Pays des Lanternois</i>,
it is probably a reference to a philosopher’s lamp, like that of Diogenes.</p></div>

δῆλοι δ’ oἱ γέροντες αὐτῶν τῷ μεγέθει τῶν λεπἰδων καἰ τῇ σκληρότητι.
Professor D’Arcy Thompson, in his translation, renders this sentence
“the age of a scaly fish may be told by the size and hardness of
the scales.” It is most probable, though not a certainty, from
contextual reasons, from Aristotle’s habit of casually harking back,
and from Pliny in his translation of it (<i>N. H.</i>, IX. 33) applying it
<i>generally</i>, that this sentence applies to all fish, and not solely
to the Tunny.</p></div>

On the other hand, Abu-Shâker, an Arab writer of the thirteenth
century, makes Aristotle the material benefactor of Alexander by his
present of a box in which a number of wax figures were nailed down.
These were intended to represent the various kinds of armed forces
that Alexander was likely to encounter. Some held leaden swords curved
backwards, some spears pointed head downwards, and some bows with cut
strings. All the figures were laid face downwards in the box. Aristotle
bade his pupil never to let the key out of his possession, and taught
him to recite certain formulæ whenever he opened the box. This is only
another use of magic, for the wax, the words of power, and the position
of the figures all indicate that his foes would become prostrate and
unable to withstand Alexander. See Budge, <i>Life of Alexander the Great</i>
(one vol. <i>ed.</i>), p. xvi.</p></div>

Of the closeness of his observation may be instanced (1) the
development by the cuttle fish during the breeding season of one of his
arms for transference to the mantle-cavity of the female—a function
of which Cuvier himself was ignorant, and which was not rediscovered
till the latter end of the last century, and (2) the method of bringing

“The belief, common later, that the soul of the dead was not admitted
immediately to the realm of Hades, but wandered in loneliness on
its confines until the body was either burned or buried, is clearly
expressed only in this (Patroclus) passage, while possibly in only
one other can it be assumed, in all the Homeric poems. The wish for
speedy rites sprang from a simpler cause; men did not want to have
the bodies of their friends, or of themselves, torn by wild beasts or
vultures: nor does this even begin to show that they had inherited old
beliefs with regard to the connection between the soul of the dead and
the body, which this soul had once inhabited, leading to a certain
treatment of the body. That in earlier times, and perhaps by many
Greeks of Homer’s age, the soul was thought to maintain a species of
connection with the body, and to care for it, cannot be doubted. But
caution is necessary that it may not be assumed that the Greeks, who
maintained certain customs, inherited also the beliefs on which those
customs were originally based” (Seymour, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 462).</p></div>

In <i>Anth. Pal.</i>, VII. 305, this epigram is headed in the MS. Ἀδδαίου
Μιτυληναίου, which is obviously wrong, for either Μιτυληναίου should
be Μακεδόνος, or Ἀδδαίου is a mistake. Bergk assigns it to Alcæus of
Messine—probably with reason, as it is not unlike his style, and his
name is more than once confused with Alcæus of Mitylene, the famous
lyric poet. (For Alcæus of Messene, see Mackail’s <i>Select Epigrams from
the Greek Anthology</i> (London, 1890), p. 297 f.) Stadtmüller the latest
editor of <i>Anth. Pal.</i> conjectures as author Alpheus of Mitylene, but
unconvincingly to Mackail and other authorities. Translated by E. W.

<i>The Faerie Queen</i>, especially Books I., II., III. Of the other
writers, I simply cite (A) <i>Piscatorie Eclogs</i>, 1633, and in a lesser
degree <i>Sicelides</i>, 1631, of Phineas Fletcher, perhaps the most
conspicuous writer of fisher Idylls in English, whom Izaak Walton
terms “an excellent divine, and an excellent angler, and author of
excellent Piscatory Eclogues”; (B) <i>Nereides or Sea Eclogues</i> (of which
only one is strictly a fisher eclogue) published anonymously in 1712,
but to be followed the next year by <i>Dryades</i>, by Diaper (translator
with his fellow Fellow of Balliol of Oppian’s <i>Halieutica</i>), which
Swift commends to Stella as the earliest book of its kind in English,
a statement which has been amplified into “the only book of its kind
in any literature,” for his Muse dives to a new Arcadia set in the
coral groves of the deep sea, and thence evokes the characters of his
Eclogues—“mermen and nereids who behave exactly like the personages in
Virgil and in Sannazaro”; (C) William Browne, <i>Britannia’s Pastorals</i>
(1613-1616), in which fishing, although but incidentally introduced, is
well and truly described, notably the passage in Book I., Song 5, about
the capture of the pike; (D) Moses Browne (who endeavoured to show that
Angling comes fairly within the range of the Pastoral), the author of
the most popular of all English fishing idylls, <i>Angling Sports in
Nine Piscatory Eclogues</i>, 1729; (E) William Thompson’s <i>Hymn to May</i>
(1758); (F) John Gay, whose <i>Rural Sports</i> (1713) is, however, more of
an angling georgic than a piscatory eclogue.</p>

<p>The eclogue, piscatory or other, was severely criticised by Dryden,
who complaining of its affectation that shepherds had always to be in
love, roundly stated, “This Phylissing comes from Italy”; by Pope, who
found fault with Theocritus because of his introduction of “fishers and
harvesters”; by Dr. Johnson, whose denunciation (in his essay, <i>The
Reason why Pastorals Delight</i>) of Sannazaro for his introduction into
the eclogue of the sea, which by presenting much less variety than
the land must soon exhaust the possibilities of marine imagery, and
known only to a few must always remain to the inlanders—the majority
of mankind—as unintelligible as a chart, dealt possibly the <i>coup de
grâce</i> to the English piscatory. See Hall, <i>op. cit.</i>, 183.</p></div>

With the execrable taste of his age Sannazaro considered himself bound
to produce still paler shades of those pale shadows, the <i>Eclogues</i>
of Virgil, just as their author, the most precedent-loving of poets,
rarely ventured to introduce an image or an incident without the
authority of some Greek original (W. M. Adams, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 45).
Moses Browne (<i>ibid.</i>) declares that it would have been far better
if Sannazaro had never written his “sea eclogues, for the exercise
of fishing appears so contemptible in him, that any that writes on a
subject, that seems to be of a similar aspect, must suffer disadvantage.”</p></div>

They must, however, now according to the evidence of the Papyri
be dated back some three centuries, <i>i.e.</i> from the usually

<p>As regards some of the Romance writers, the Papyri are a revelation

“the critics place variously between the fifth and the ninth
centuries <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>”) is fixed by Pap., <i>Fayum
Towns</i>, as <i>before</i> 150 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Achilles
Tatius, whose allotted span, owing to his imitation of Heliodorus
(who hitherto has been dated about the end of the fourth century),
was run “about the latter half of the fifth or beginning of the
sixth century,” is now placed by Pap., <i>Oxyrh.</i>, 1250, as living
before 300, and thus Heliodorus is removed up to (<i>c.</i>) 250 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p></div>

includes all Greek and Græco-Roman writers as distinct from the
Byzantine, and includes also the earlier and better prose writers,
like Heliodorus and Longus. Epigrams, it is true, continued to be
written until the fourteenth century, but there is little, and that of

Latin the fisherman has no place as a pastoral character. The hut and

Some recent scholars hold that Poseidon was an early differentiation
of Zeus, and that his fish-spear was developed from the three-pronged
lightning symbol of that deity as soon as the former became himself
specialised into first a river god, and second a sea god. From my
friend Mr. A. B. Cook’s forthcoming work, <i>Zeus</i>, vol. ii. c. 6, s. 4,
I learn that the commonly supposed Trident (in Æschylus, <i>Septem.</i>,
I. 31), “the fish-striking tool of the sea-god,” is more likely in
pre-classical times to have been the three-pronged lightning symbol
of the highest Deity of all, and observable not only in Greece,
but also in Asia. Against this view lies the fact that only once
in all the Greek art is Poseidon represented with an unmistakable
thunder-bolt, and this is on a silver tetradrachm of Messana about 450
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> The name Poseidon merely equals, it is
held, ποτεί-Δας, or ‘Lord Zeus,’ the correlative of πότνια Ἥρη, ‘Lady
Hera.’</p></div>

<i>Ibid.</i> As Pan was worshipped as the god of animals,
especially of herds, on land, so did the fisherfolk venerate him, Πὰν
ἅκτιος (Theocr., <i>Id.</i>, V. 14) or ἁλίπλαγκτος (Soph., <i>Aj.</i>, 695:
cf. <i>Anth. Pal.</i>, X. 10), as the god of the animals of the sea, and
in especial for his service to them in netting Typhon, whose “winds
wrought havoc to their boats, and when Auster with Sirocco breath
prevailed, caused their catches to go bad.” At Athens the god was
regarded with gratitude as a powerful benefactor, because of the aid
vouchsafed in securing naval victories (Hdt., 6. 105. Simonides <i>frag.</i>
133, Bergk<sup>4</sup>)</p></div>

To Janus, however, the credit of being the first to teach

early <i>as libralis</i> had a head of Janus on one side and the prow of a
ship on the other (Roscher, <i>Lex. Myth.</i>, II. p. 23).</p></div>

The Phigaleans (in Arkadia) worshipped an old wooden image, called
Eurynome, which represented a woman to the hips, a fish below. This
curious effigy was kept bound in golden chains and was regarded by
the inhabitants as a form of Artemis: see Paus., 8. 41, 4-6. A large
Bœotian vase at Athens shows Artemis with a great fish painted on the
front of her dress, a clear indication that she was held locally to be
a goddess of fishing (M. Collignon and L. Couve, <i>Catalogue des Vases

died, an offering must on the self-same day be burnt on the altar. Cf.

The νέοι παῖδες in the oracles’ warning to Homer, which seem at first
sight antagonistic to the above, become in Homer’s own words of
greeting, ἅνδρες. Perhaps the employment of νέων παίδων by the Delphic
priestess may be due (1) to the fact that they were “fish-boys” proper,
(2) to an early and intelligent anticipation of the “juvenescent”
tendency, or (3) to the exigency, not unknown to sixth form
Hexameter-makers of the present, but (alas! if Oxford and Cambridge be

Translated by Andrew Lang, 1889. The question whether Leonidas of
Tarentum was, and Theocritus was not, the author of this Idyll is
exhaustively treated by R. J. Cholmeley, <i>Theocritus</i>, pp. 54, 55.
Whatever conclusion be reached, constant are the references in
those Idylls whose authenticity is undoubted to fish and fishing;
even in his familiar comparisons Theocritus thinks of the sea. Mr.
Lang writes, “There is nothing in Wordsworth more real, more full
of the incommunicable sense of Nature, rounding and softening the
toilsome days of the aged and poor, than the Theocritean poem of <i>The
Fisherman’s Dream</i>. It is as true to Nature as the statue of the naked
fisherman in the Vatican.”</p></div>

This is but one instance of anachronistic translation, or the use of
terms, which, if true of our modern line, are inapplicable to ancient
angling, for if, as I have shown in the Introduction, all ancient
angling was with a <i>tight</i> line, the operation translated as “I took in
line” should rather be rendered “I tightened on him.” The alternation
of easing and tightening is a well-known device. It is a question of
the degree of strain involved. If you want to keep a big fish quiet in
a confined space or in difficult circumstances, you can generally do
so by keeping a very light strain on him, so that, though the line is
never absolutely slack, he hardly knows that he is hooked and is often
landed without the angler having to yield a foot of his line. Thus the
roach-fisher without a reel sometimes lands a 4 lb. chub or bream with
a foot link of single hair, entirely by this method of <i>suaviter in
modo</i>. There seems no particular reason why Asphalion should not have
been cognisant of these secrets, which three lines in James Thomson’s
<i>The Seasons</i>, although the fight is, I admit, with a running line,
fairly disclose.</p>

To a practical angler this passage is not clear. How is it possible,
after you have taken out the hook (the only apparent method of holding
the big fish), to fasten round him ropes and drag him ashore, unless
he were beached high and dry? Of this we have no evidence beyond
ἀνείλκυσα, if used here in its nautical sense “to haul up high and
dry.” The readings suggested by Wordsworth and others are numerous, but
none seem quite satisfactory, even those preferred by J. M. Edmonds,
<i>The Greek Bucolic Poets</i>, London, 1912, and R. J. Cholmeley, <i>op.
cit.</i> Perhaps the least improbable text is that given by E. Hiller
(Leipzig, 1881), καὶ τὸν μὲν πίστευσα καλῶς ἒχεν ἠπειρώταν, “and I
really believed that I had him fairly landed.” This has the positive
merit of sticking close to the manuscript reading, and the negative
merit of refusing to admit the absurd ‘ropes.’</p></div>

“Theocritus gives nature, not behind the footlights, but beneath the
truthful blaze of Sicily’s sunlit sky. For it was here that the first
vibrations of this spontaneous note were heard in their original
purity, before art could distort them with allegory, or echo weaken
them with imitation. This is all the more remarkable from the contrast
which it offers to what Kingsley calls the ‘artificial jingle’ of the
Alexandrian school. Simplicity, honesty, truth, and beauty recommend
Theocritus as a genuine artist. His imitators, as compared with their
model, were like—</p>

<p class="no-indent">as he himself describes (<i>Id.</i>, VII. 47) Homer’s imitators.”
Against this verdict by H. Snow on the Alexandrians must be set the more
truthful appreciation of their work by Mackail, <i>op. cit.</i>, pp.
178-207, especially p. 184: “They are called artificial poets, as
though all poetry were not artificial, and the greatest poetry were not
the poetry of the most consummate artifice.”</p></div>

See Hall, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 22 (1914), and <i>ibid.</i>, p. 35 (1912). Lucian,
although a Syrian (to which nation fish was from the earliest times a
forbidden food), frequently shows himself very conversant with fishes
and avails himself of their characteristics: <i>e.g.</i> Menelaus, after
witnessing some of the “turns” of that celebrated “lightning-change
artist,” Proteus, exclaims frankly, “there must be some fraud!” The
artist pooh-poohs him and bids him consider the everyday miracle of
invisibility wrought by the Polypus, who having “selected his rock
and having attached himself by means of his suckers, assimilates
himself to it, changing his colour to match that of the rock. Thus
there is no contrast of colour to betray his presence: he looks
just like a stone” (<i>Dialogues of the Sea Gods</i>, iv. 1-3, Fowler’s
<i>Translation</i>).</p></div>

Ovid has, I believe, more piscatory passages than any other poet,

<i>Latin Literature</i> (1906), p. 193. “Martial’s gift for occasional
verse just enabled him to live up three pair of stairs in the city:
in later years he could just afford a tiny country house among the
Sabine hills.” This three-pair-back theory seems a bit strained, for he
often speaks of his <i>Nomentanus ager</i>, a small farm at Nomentum, which
yielded excellent wine. Cf. <i>Ep.</i>, II. 38; VI. 43; XIII. 119. He owned,
in addition to a house in Rome, apparently another small place at Tibur
(IV. 80); so his complaints of being a “pauper” must be understood only
in a relative sense. Thither he goes chiefly, he delicately insinuates,
for the pleasure of seeing Ovid, who was his neighbour there. Cf. also VII. 93.</p></div>

The client had to be at his patron’s house in the morning and attend
him, there or anywhere, all day if necessary. It was an act of
disrespect to appear before his patron without donning the toga. Cf.
Juvenal, VII. 142, and VIII. 49; also I. 96 and 119, and X. 45, and
Martial, <i>Ep.</i>, X. 10. In prose the most caustic description of the
client-and-patron institution may be found in Lucian, <i>Nigrinus</i>,
20-26. In <i>Ep.</i>, XII. 18, to poor Juvenal dancing attendance in Rome
on his patron and sweating in the requisite toga he recounts the many
delights of his home in Spain: among them “ignota est toga,” a blazing
fire of oak cut from the adjoining coppice, and lastly the <i>venator</i>
or keeper, whose attractions in lines 22-3 do not appeal to the modern
sportsman. I draw attention to these lines, because they reflect quite
casually, but quite clearly, the decadent vices of the age: remember,
they are not quotations from some obscure, if obscene, versifier, but
were written (and published!) by the second poet to the first poet
of that generation. It has been pointed out that in the epigrams of
Martial with which Juvenal is connected some obscenity usually creeps
in. Cf. <i>Ep.</i>, VII. 91.</p></div>

Pliny (XXXII., 21) and other writers show that epicures, then as now,
were divided as to which was the best oyster. Mucianus awards the palm
over all the other oysters to those from Cyzicus: “Cyzicena majora
Lucrinis, dulciora Britannicis, suaviora Medulis, acriora Lepticis,
pleniora Lucensibus, sicciora Coryphantenis, teneriora Istricis,
candidiora Circeiensibus,” but Pliny in “Sed his neque dulciora neque
teneriora esse ulla, compertum est,” evidently plumps for those of
Circeii in Latium. The British oysters came chiefly from Rutupiæ (in
Kent), now Richborough, not far from our Whitstable of oyster fame. The
castle and camps of Rutupiæ and Regulbum were built by the Romans to
command and secure the entrance to the Thames by the arm of the sea,
which then separated Kent from the Isle of Thanet. These oysters find
mention in Juvenal (IV. 141), “Rutupinoque edita fundo Ostrea callebat
primo deprendere morsu.” Dalecampius says of them, “Præstantissima
nutriunt.” Our modern rule that no oyster should be eaten in a month
whose name lacks an <i>r</i> probably descends from the Mediæval</p>

<i>Cantu</i> seems to refer more naturally to the song of the call
bird (Oppian, <i>hal.</i>, IV. 120 ff.), rather than to that of
the fowler, but cf. Cato (the poet of the third century <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span>), in <i>Disticha</i>, I. 27, “Fistula dulce canit
volucrem dum decipit auceps”; and <i>Tibullus</i>, II. 5, 31, “Fistula cui
semper decrescit harundinis ordo.” In addition to catching birds by
rods and birdlime, a common practice according to Aristophanes was
to confine doves, etc., with limbs tied up or with eyes covered, in
a net, and thus allure other doves, etc., to the snare. <i>Illex</i> was
the technical name for the decoy bird. For this purpose use was made
both of kindred and of hostile species, such as the owl and falcon.
The latter was also trained to catch the bird, which had been decoyed within
its reach. Cf. Martial, <i>Ep.</i>, XIV. 218. Aristophanes, <i>Aves</i>, 1082 f.</p>

“This idea of rumination,” according to Mr. Lones, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 237,
“by the parrot wrasse (Scarus cretensis), which is clearly the Skaros
of the Ancients, probably arose from its grazing or cropping off marine
plants, and grinding them down, assisted by its having a strongly
walled stomach” (cf. the functions of the gizzard of a fowl) with
which, out of the myriads of fishes, the <i>scarus</i> and his tribe alone
are endowed. On p. 162, “The stomach of a skaros is without a cæcum,
and appears to be of far simpler form than that of most fishes.”</p>

<p>A trout often appears to ruminate, working its jaws quietly for a
considerable time—perhaps this is merely to settle its last mouthful
comfortably and to its liking. According to Banfield, in Dunk and
other islands off Northern Australia, a fish, very similar to only
even more brilliant in hues than the <i>Pseudoscarus rivulatus</i>, is able
by the strength of its teeth (some sixty or seventy, set incisorlike)
to pull from the rocks limpets (its chief food), which when steadfast
can resist a pulling force of nearly 2000 times their own weight! It
swallows molluscs and cockles whole, and by its wonderful gizzard grinds
them fine. See <i>Confessions of a Beachcomber</i> (London, 1913), p. 156.</p></div>

“Dapping,” to which I miss allusion even in Dr. Turrell’s excellent
<i>Ancient Angling Authors</i>, is so often regarded as a more or less
modern method that, even at the risk of a portentous note, I must
record my reasons for differing <i>in toto</i> from this view. Walton
certainly employed it in the seventeenth century. Pursuing the device
further back, it is distinctly enjoined in the earliest fishing
treatise in English, the earlier version of <i>The Boke of St. Albans</i>
(<i>i.e.</i> a MS. of about 1450 printed from a MS. in the possession of A.
Denison, Esq., with Preface and Glossary by T. Satchell, London, 1883),
and seems, although not clearly described, surely specified as follows:
In “How many maner of Anglynges that ther bene ... The IIIIth with a
mener for the troute with owte plumbe or floote the same maner of Roche
and Darse with a lyne of I or II herys batyd with a flye. The Vth is
with a dubbed hooke for the troute and graylyng....” This passage draws
a decided distinction between baiting with a fly and a dubbed hook, or
artificial fly. But no lead (plumbe) or float was to be used, therefore
the method intended seems without doubt “dapping,” which warrants, to
my mind, the assumption that this device is as old as the earliest
instructions in English. This older form of the Treatise seems, it is
true, to have differed slightly from the version used for <i>The Boke
of St. Albans</i> in 1496. T. Satchell held that they both had a common
origin in the “bokes of credence,” which are mentioned in the latter,
and may, he suggests, have been French, but of this I am doubtful,
principally because the French and English traditions appear to me to
have marked points of difference.</p></div>

“Il est peu de poissons et même d’animaux qui aient été, pour les
premiers peuples civilisés de l’Europe, l’objet de plus de recherches,
d’attention, et d’éloges que le Scare” (Lacépède). On the family of the
<i>Labridæ</i> (of which the <i>Scarus</i> forms a genus) the same author asserts
that Nature has not conferred either strength or power, but they have
received as their share of her favours, agreeable proportions, great
activity of fin, and adornment with all the colours of the rainbow.
Of the two cousins of the <i>Scarus</i>, the <i>Turdus</i> and the <i>Julis</i>, his
eulogy can not be omitted: “Le feu du diamant, du rubis, de la topaz,
de l’émeraude, du saphir, de l’améthyste, du grenat scintille sur
leures écailles polies: et brille sur leure surface en gouttes, en
croissants, en raies, en bandes, en anneaux, en ceintures, en zones, en
ondes; il se mêle à l’éclat de l’or et d’argent qui y resplendit sur de
grandes places, les teintes obscures, les aires pâles, et pour ainsi
dire décolorées.” Nicander of Thyatira (<i>cp.</i> Athen. 7, 113) states
that there were two kinds of <i>Scarus</i>, one αἰόλος of many diverse
colours, the other ὀνίας of a dull grey tint.</p></div>

Archestratus is constantly quoted and always praised by Athenæus
as “excellent,” “experienced,” etc. Archestratus the Syracusan in
his work—variously termed “Gastronomy,” “Hedypathy,” “Deipnology,”
“Cookery”—begins his epic poem, “Here to all Greece I open wisdom’s
store”! (Yonge’s trans.). From delivering his precepts in the style and
with the gravity of the old gnomic poets, Archestratus was dubbed “the
Hesiod or Theognis of opsophagists.” The comic poets have many a gibe
at him, <i>e.g.</i> Dionysius of Sinope sums up the author of <i>Gastronomy</i>,
τὰ πολλὰ δ’ ἠγνόηκε, κοὐδὲ ἒν λέγει (<i>Thesmophorus</i>, <i>frag.</i> I. 26,
Meineke)! Before publishing this work, the author travelled far and
wide to make himself master of every dish that could be served at
table. Known to us almost entirely as a supreme <i>bon vivant</i>, and as
the earliest (except Terpsion) and certainly greatest <i>Mrs. Glasse</i> of
the Greeks, his accuracy of description of the various fishes used for
the table was so consistent, that we find even so high an authority
as Aristotle making use of it in his Natural History. Archestratus in
his travels concerned himself not at all as to the manners or morals
of the countries visited, “as it is impossible to change these,” and
held little or no intercourse with any but those, <i>e.g.</i> <i>chefs</i>,
who could advance the pleasures of taste. Whatever the cause, whether too
many sauces or too little nutritive food, he was so small and lean that
the scales are supposed to have returned his weight as not even one
obol! (Cf. Hayward, <i>The Art of Dining</i>). Hayward himself must have
appreciated the limitation of guests, which Archestratus imposes for a
proper dinner</p>

Ælian, XVI. 19, writes that these sea-hares were so poisonous, that
if a man touched one thrown up on the shore with his hand, he shortly
died, unless medicine was at once administered. So poisonous indeed
are they, that “if you touch them with but your walking stick, there
is the same danger which contact with a lizard evokes,” which in II. 5
is described τέθνηκεν ὁ κύριος τῆς λύγου! Nero, to “mak siccar” (like
Kirkpatrick with the Red Comyn), employed the sea-hare as a dainty for
friends whose deaths he earnestly desired. Cf. Philostratus, <i>Life of
Apollonius of Tyana</i>, VI. 32.</p></div>

Nonnius, always the alert defender of his favourite fish, ingeniously
suggests that the <i>scarus</i> of Pythagoras was not our famous <i>scarus</i>,
because as this fish, even during the Augustan period, was extremely
rare in Italian waters, there seems little necessity for its being
banned by the “Hyperborean Apollo of the Crotoniates” in <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span> 540-510. Numa, apparently influenced by
Pythagorean precepts, forbade (according to Cassius Hemina, Pliny,
XXXII. 10) all scaleless fish being offered to the gods. Festus, p.
253, a. 20, however, states that in such offerings it was allowable
to present all fish with scales, except the <i>Scarus</i>, which was
sacrificiable, and most acceptable to the god of the peasants,
Hercules, whose “swinish gluttony | Crams and blasphemes his feeder.”
For <i>squaram</i>, Müller suggests <i>scarum</i>, while Lindsay prints
<i>squatum</i>, the skate.</p></div>

Aristotle (according to Athen., VIII. 3) states that the <i>scarus</i> and
sea-hog are the only fishes that have any kind of voice, but in reality
he (IV. 9) mentions five others, among which is the cuckoo-fish, who
“whistle and grunt” (see Pliny, XI. 112; Oppian, I. 134-5). Athenæus
errs, for Aristotle (<i>N. H.</i>, IV. 9, 8) asserts that the Dolphin when
out of the water “groans and cries”; while Pliny (IX. 7) says of
the Dolphin, “Pro voce gemitus humano similis.” Aristotle expressly
differentiates between the five mentioned fish and the Dolphin—for the
former possess no lungs, windpipe, or pharynx, and so can produce no
voice, only “sound,” while “the dolphin has a <i>voice</i> and therefore
utters vocal and vowel sounds, for it is furnished with a lung and a windpipe.”</p></div>

Someone may throw at me the sentence of Seleucus of Tarsus, who
in the only English translation of Athenæus (by C. D. Yonge) is
made to say (VII. 113), “The Scarus is the only fish which <i>never</i>
sleeps.” If Yonge had been faithful to the text (Schweighäuser’s)
which he expressly states he had adopted, he would have omitted the
οὐ, because it is in brackets and the editor expressly puts against
it the note “Deest vulgo negativa particula,” and his accompanying
Latin translation is “unum hunc ex omnibus piscibus dormire.” Kaibel
(Leipzig, 1887) also brackets the οὐ, while Dindorf (1827) has no οὐ,
bracketed or other.</p></div>

Aristotle, <i>N. H.</i>, II. 13; Pliny, XI. 61. Another instance of the
carelessness of Athenæus—induced perhaps by his omnivorous reading—is
to be found in the first line of VII. 113, “The Scarus, Aristotle says,
has sharp or jagged teeth,” whereas a reference to <i>N. H.</i>, II. 13,
discloses that all fish <i>except</i> the <i>scarus</i> have sharp or jagged
teeth, a statement which is confirmed by Rondolet.</p></div>

A century or so before Oppian, Demostratus, a Roman Senator, wrote
also Ἁλιευτικά—a work on Fishing of twenty books—which, although often
quoted by ancient writers, is now not extant. From the extracts given
by Ælian (XIII. 21, XV. 4 and 19) we gather that Demostratus, who wrote
in Greek, had even more than a Greek love of the marvellous and cared
nothing for the sober scientific study of his subject. It is noteworthy
that an alternative title of his work was λόγοι ἁλιευτικοί, or, say,
Fishing Yarns.</p></div>

As there are 3506 hexameters, the reward was over 3506 guineas
sterling, which, without allowing for the increase in value of money
between the second century and the twentieth, contrasts remarkably
with the fourpence halfpenny a volume of Martial. According to Suidas,
however, Oppian received from the Emperor 20,000 <i>staters</i>, which
would be a far larger reward than Octavia bestowed on Virgil for his
<i>Æneid</i>. It has been suggested that this largesse was not paid on all
the verses of the <i>Halieutica</i>, but only on those in which Oppian
records the prowess and sport of the Emperor in “The Virginia Water”
of the Cæsars—where we learn from Eutropius (VII. 14) that Nero fished
with golden nets drawn by purple ropes. If so the total would be a mere
fraction of either the 3506 guineas or of the 16,000 guineas. Great
doubt exists as to whether or not there were two poets named Oppian;
and if there were, to which does the anonymous Greek <i>Life</i> of Oppian
refer, and which of the two was the author of <i>Ixeutica</i>, for possibly
it was to the author of this poem that the Imperial payment of gold was
made. See W. H. Drummond’s paper in Royal Irish Academy, 1818. Also

The great objection to this translation, owing probably to the
difficulty of expressing—certainly of compressing—the “intractable”
subject matter in the rhymed verse adopted by the translators, is
its weary verbiage: for instance, one passage of three lines in the

With δόναξ and κύρτος, cf. the πλεκτὸν ὕφασμα in Archestratus (<i>frag.</i>
xv. 6). See pp. 147 and 176 ff. of Paulus Brandt’s <i>Parodorum epicorum
Græcorum et Archestrati Reliquiæ</i>, Leipzig, 1888. Brandt argues
that the expression describes a <i>nassa, qua retis loco piscatores
utebantur</i>, and on the analogy of the Dalmatian fishermen (cf. Brehm,
<i>Thierleben</i>, IV., vol. II. p. 533) who, when the sea is not quite
calm, drop from the bow of the boat pebbles dipped in oil to make
smooth the surface, and so more easily detect the fish, explains δονεῖν
ψήφους in <i>Frag.</i> XV. line 8. Although Archestratus’s statement that
the fish are not to be seen (oὐd’ ἐσιδεῖν ὄσσοισιν), except by those
who resort to the πλεκτὸν ὕφασμα, and εἰώθασι δονεῖν ψήφους, gives some
colour to Brandt’s ingenious identification, the lack of any mention
of the essential factor in such a calming operation, the oil, seems to
rule it out.</p></div>

This method, originating from the curiosity of fish and their desire
(in Shelley’s words) “to worship the delusive flame,” is especially
successful in rivers at the spawning season. In the Rhodian Laws—a code
for the government of mariners and fishermen originally promulgated by
Tiberius—occurs a special proviso, <i>re</i> fishing by means of torches,
forbidding fishermen to display lights at sea, lest thereby they
should deceive other vessels. It has been suggested, prettily, but
I fear not practically, that leistering was learnt from the hunting
habit and natural endowments of the Halcyon or Kingfisher; just as to
the brilliancy of its colours and splendour of its flash the fish are
attracted, so to the brightness of the torches and the shimmer of their
rays come the salmon, etc.</p></div>

Perhaps the best prose description of the power of the Echineis is
to be found in Cassiodorus, <i>Var.</i>, I. 35. Pliny, XXXII. 1, solemnly
asserts that the death of the Emperor Caligula was presaged by a
<i>Remora</i> stopping his great galley, alone out of all the accompanying
fleet, on his voyage to Antium. Not only did the <i>Remora</i> stop a
ship, but according to Pliny, it could, from its power of checking
the natural actions of the body under excitement, hasten or stay an
<i>accouchement</i> as well as a lawsuit: hence plaintiffs seldom ventured
into the fish market, because the mere sight of a <i>Remora</i> at such a
juncture was most inauspicious! (Pliny, IX. 41, and XXXII. 1). Cf.
Aristotle, <i>H. A.</i>, 2. 14, “καὶ χρῶνταί τινες αὐτῷ πρὸς δίκας καὶ
φίλτρα.” For an explanation of the myth of the <i>Remora</i>, see V. W.

Athen., III. 46. From Faber, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 94, we learn that “the
pinnotherus finds refuse in the shells of living bivalves, living on
the small animalculæ contained in the constant stream of water, which
flows in and out of these molluscs. The fancy of the ancients has
attributed the status existing between the two species as arising from
a friendly alliance, protection and board afforded on the one hand, and
watching against and warning of the approach of an enemy on the other.
These observations descend from so early a date that we find the pinna
and the crab among the Egyptian hieroglyphs, bearing the interpretation
of the duty of paterfamilias to provide for his offspring.”</p></div>

Perizonius has proved that Ælian transferred large portions of
the <i>Deipnosophistæ</i> of Athenæus to his <i>Varia Historia</i>, a
robbery which must have been committed almost in the lifetime of
the pillaged author: that Ælian extended such transference to
his <i>Natural History</i> also, his story of the <i>Pinna</i>, and others
would seemingly demonstrate. Sir J. E. Sandys, <i>A History of
Classical Scholarship</i>, ed. 2 (Cambridge, 1906), i. 336, goes so
far as to say: “He is the author of seventeen books <i>On Animals</i>,
mainly borrowed from Alexander of Myndos (first century

IX. 32. “In Aquitania salmo fluvialis marinis omnibus prefertur.”
To make this clear <i>piscibus</i> should be understood after <i>omnibus</i>.
The salmon is the fish most frequently found in the débris of the
French caves, many of which are in Aquitania, so Palæolithic and
Plinian man at any rate ate tooth to tooth in their preference.
See Introduction. It is somewhat amazing, considering their
opsophagy and the excellence of the fish, that down to 500 <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> no Greek, and no Latin writer, except
Pliny, Ausonius, and Sidonius, <i>Ep.</i> II. 2, mentions the <i>Salmonidæ</i>.
I cannot forgo Ausonius’s epithet—mouth-filling yet appropriate—for
us, who dwell in “this blessed Isle, this England,” <i>Aquilonigenasque
Britannos</i>.</p></div>

Salmon appear but infrequently in representations, but Plate 8 in
C. W. King’s <i>Roman Antiquities at Lydney Park, Gloucestershire</i>,
London, 1879, shows in colours a mosaic dedicated to the god Nodons
by Flavius Senilis, an officer in command of the fleet stationed off
the Severn: this mosaic includes a number of <i>salmon</i>. King, <i>ib.</i>
Plate 13, 2, is a diadem of beaten bronze representing a fisherman
with a pointed cap in the act of hooking with undoubtedly a <i>tight</i>
line a fine salmon: cf. A. B. Cook’s discussion of these finds in
<i>Folk-Lore</i>, 1906, XVI. 37 ff. Nodons was in fact, like Nuada, a fish
god, indeed a Celtic understudy for Neptune. If salmon figure little
in representations, they bulk large in laws, and in commissariats for
campaigns, <i>e.g.</i> 3000 dried salmon were ordered by Edw. II. in his
war with Bruce.</p></div>

The biggest Pike ever caught in the United Kingdom seems to be the
72-pounder mentioned by Colonel Thornton in his “Sporting Tour.”
Walton’s ring-decorated fish (see Gesner), three hundred years or so

40-50 lbs. is very exceptional.</p></div>

The value of the herring (<i>Clupea harengus</i>) was unknown to the
Greeks and Romans, and so remained generally till the Middle Ages.
“Ignorance, presumably of the real nature of the Cetaceans betrayed
our forefathers into breaking Lent, for under the impression that
the whale, porpoise, and seal were fish, they ate them on fast
days. High prices, moreover, were paid for such meats, and porpoise
pudding was a dish of State as late as the sixteenth century” (P.
Robinson, <i>Fisheries Exhibition Literature</i>, Pt. III. p. 42). Some
laxity may, I think, be pardoned, for the very name “porpoise”
(in Guernsey <i>pourpeis</i>)—derived apparently from <i>porc-peis</i>
(<i>porcum</i> + <i>piscem</i>)—implies that the creature was regarded as a
“pig-fish.”</p></div>

Akin to this we have the special prohibition—unique as

eating <i>sea</i> fish, because Poseidon was god of the sea, and owner and
protector of its denizens. Plutarch, <i>De solert. an.</i>, 35, 11. At other
of his temples, <i>e.g.</i> in Laconia, the fate awaiting a violator of the
sacred fish was that common to poachers of similar holy waters, death.</p></div>

the fishing occurs in some non-Greek water, as in the Tiber (Galen,

in Athen., VIII. 56, which is merely a quotation from a treatise of

poisson d’eau douce comptait à peine dans la consommation du poisson
de mer: seules les anguilles du lac Copaïs avaient quelque renom.
Mais la pêche maritime eut toujours beaucoup plus d’importance.”

An amusing instance of official interference is recorded in Apuleius,

fish for dinner from a fishmonger at Hypata in Thessaly, who demanded
100 <i>nummi</i> (<i>denarii</i>): after much haggling, 20 <i>denarii’s</i> worth
is bought and being taken home, when the local ædile intervenes, seizes
the parcel on account of the extravagant charge, and destroys the
fish in the presence of the seller. The result, which Lucius bewails,
was loss of both dinner, and <i>denarii</i>!</p></div>

that fish-food increases the grey matter of our brain. Holland’s
translation of Plutarch is not complimentary: “hence it is we call
those gluttons who love belly-cheer so well opsophagists.”</p></div>

In charity to the Greeks may I hazard the plea (the rules of even
the Law Courts are now sensibly relaxed) that their delight in
Brobdingnagian meals may have originated in the days when their gods
walked with men on earth, or grew up later as the sincerest form of
flattery? No one in Homer keeps his eye more skinned or his nose more
active than a god, when hecatombs “are about.” The Olympians flit
constantly to Æthiopia and are impatient of any business, mundane
or heavenly, which interferes with a trip thither, when with the
keen scent (or vision?) of vultures, they smell (or see?) hecatombs
in preparation in the heart of the Dark Continent, where the
inhabitants, as a scholiast tells us, kept a feast for twelve days,
<i>one for every god</i>! See A. Shewan’s <i>Homeric Games at an Ancient St.
Andrews</i> (Edinburgh, 1911), p. 116—a most delightful and destructive
skit at the expense of <i>The Higher Criticism</i> of Homer!</p></div>

The greatest number of <i>fish</i> which I can count at any feast
mentioned in Athenæus (in Bk. IV. 13) amounts to only thirty-two!
Badham (p. 587) omits to state that the whole poem is nothing but a
parody, chiefly of Homer, by Matron, and is <i>not</i> a “Bill of fare of
an Attic supper” in any sense.</p></div>

Sammonicus Serenus, a <i>savant</i> of the early third century <span

to table to the accompaniment of flutes by servants crowned with
flowers. Cf. Macrob. III. 16, 7 f. Cf. Athen. VII. 44, and Ælian,
VIII. 28.</p>

<p>In describing this imaginary Attic supper, Badham certainly lets
himself go. The allusion to “the present of the God of Love” he
may have taken from an anonymous epigram in Burmann’s <i>Anthologia</i>
(1773), Bk. V. 217.</p>

<p>These lines, of which several variants exist (notably that of the Rose
Cellar in the Rathskeller of Bremen), are founded on the legend that
Cupid bribed the God of Silence with his mother’s flower not to divulge
the amours of Venus. Hence a host hung a rose over his table as a sign
that nothing there said was to be repeated. A quaint and touching
legend runs that in the beginning all roses were white, but when Venus
walking one day among the flowers was pricked by one of their thorns,
these roses “drew their colour from the blood of the goddess,” and
remained encarmined for ever. Cf. Natal. Com. <i>Mythol.</i>, V. 13. See

“The Treatise we now possess is a sort of Cook-Confectioners’ Manual,
containing a multitude of recipes for preparing and cooking all kinds
of flesh, fish, and fowl. From the solecisms of style it is probable
that it was compiled at a late period by one who prefixed the name of
Apicius in order to attract attention and insure the circulation of his
book.”—Smith’s <i>Dict. Gk. Rom. Biog. and Myth.</i></p>

<p>Teuffel and Schwabe, <i>History of Roman Literature</i> (trans. G. C.
W. Warr, London, 1892), II. 28 f., point out that <i>Cœlius</i> Apicius,
the traditional author of the work <i>de re coquinaria</i>, should rather
be <i>Cœlii</i> Apicius, <i>i.e.</i> “the Apicius of Cœlius,” <i>Apicius</i> being
the title and Cœlius the writer. The book was founded on Greek
originals.</p>

<p>In Seneca (<i>ad. Helv.</i>, 10), “sestertium milies in culinam
consumpsit.” See Martial, III. 22, who flays Apicius with biting scorn
in his—</p>

being sacrificiable was because it could be brought alive to the altar
and its blood poured out on it. Stengel’s argument, especially in
association with his remark that sacrifices of fish were as scarce
as those of game, is not convincing, for why should not other fishes
be kept alive in water till the hour of oblation? The belief in the
sanctity of the Eel pertains even unto our day, for in the spring at
Bergas (between the Dardanelles and Lapsaki) they are or were before
the War inviolate.</p></div>

Nonnius, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 155. Apart from fashionable mania, the
<i>salsamentum</i> was used for very practical purposes, <i>e.g.</i> as food
for the Athenian soldier on campaign. Cf. Aristoph., <i>Ach.</i>, 1101, 2.
From the frequent notices and quotations in Athenæus, Euthydemus the
Athenian seems to have been the most prolific author on pickled fish. On him
and his three treatises, see Pauly-Winowa, <i>Real. Enc.</i>, VI. 1505.</p></div>

<i>À propos</i> of the fish-trade of Olbia, Koehler (in the <i>Mém. de l’Acad.
des Sciences de St. Petersburg</i>, VI<sup>me</sup> série, tome 1, p.
347, St. Petersburg, 1832, as quoted by E. H. Minns, <i>Scythians and
Greeks</i>, Cambridge, 1913, p. 440) concludes that preserved fish of
every quality, from jars of precious pickle, corresponding to our
caviare or anchovy, to dried lumps answering to our stock-fish were
all sent to Greece, and later to Rome, from the mouths of Dnêpr and
the sea of Azov. As regards some of the small <i>copper</i> coins of Olbia,
Mr. G. F. Hill, <i>A Handbook of Greek and Roman Coins</i> (London, 1899),
p. 3, writes: “If these are coins, they differ from the ordinary
Greek coin only in the fact that, instead of putting a fish type on
a flan of ordinary shape, the whole coin was made in the shape of
a fish. Another explanation is suggested by the fact that a pig of
metal was sometimes called δελφίς. These fish-shaped pieces may be the
degenerate representatives of similar-shaped pigs of bronze.” He refers
to Ardaillon, <i>Les Mines du Laurin</i>, p. 111, who compares the French
<i>saumon</i> with the meaning of “a pig of metal.”</p></div>

In Pitra, <i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 508-512, will be found a list of 156 coins,
gems, etc., illustrating the connection of various fishes with deities
and places. For the coins of Carteia, see A. Heiss, <i>Description
générale des monnaies antiques de l’Espagne</i>, Paris, 1870, p. 331 f.,
pl. 49, 19-21 (= my Fig. <i>supra</i>). The <i>salsamentum</i> of this town was
in special request; its boasted excellence might be perhaps accounted
for by Strabo’s statement that the diet of the Tunnies off Carteia
consisted of acorns which grew in that sea, just as land acorns with an
occasional truffle achieve, according to gourmets, for the Spanish pig
the primacy of hams. Alas! for such conjecture, science shows that the
Tunny throve on <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i>, not acorns. Cf. Keller, <i>op. cit.</i> 383.</p></div>

Some authorities (Preller, <i>Griech. Myth.</i>, I. 191) believe the head
to be that of Artemis, not only the protectress of Arethusa, but also
the goddess of rivers and springs, and of the fish therein—one of
her emblems was a fish. Some coins show her or Arethusa’s head with
seaweed plaited in the hair, or the hair plaited in a sort of fish-net
surrounded by little fish. The whole island of Ortygia was absolutely
dedicated to Artemis—no plough could cut a furrow, no net ensnare a
fish, without instantly encountering a sea of troubles. See Keller,
<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 343. The sacred fish were seen by Diodorus (V. 3) as
late as Octavian’s reign.</p></div>

the pearls from them, as being “small and discoloured;” wherefore (IX.
57) Julius Cæsar, when he presented a <i>thorax</i> to Venus Genetrix, had
it made of British “pearls,” a very poor requital to a goddess, who, if
Suetonius is to be trusted, had so often stood him in good stead, both
as a distant ancestress, and in other connections! Some really fine

The explanation for this by Nonnius, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 75—that the
Greek coasts, from being surrounded on all sides by seas, yielded
ample supplies of fish, while the Romans, “whose seas were not so
near,” were not as fortunate and were compelled to be more instant in
pisciculture—is a statement at the best doubtful, and certainly not supported
by the existence of <i>vivaria</i> in Sicily, lapped on every side by seas.</p></div>

The existence of such gigantic craft has been called in question, but
is proved by an inscription from the temple of the Paphian Aphrodite in

<p>Cicero, <i>Ep. ad Att.</i>, XX. I., “Our leading people think that they
attain unto Heaven if they own in their ponds bearded mullets, who
will come to them to be stroked.” Cf. Lucian (<i>De Dea Syria</i>, 45-48).
Ælian, VIII. 4, confirms these statements, and in 12. 30, tells of
a spring in Caria sacred to Zeus, in which were kept eels decked
with earrings and chains of gold, while Pliny, XXXII. 8, writes that
at the Temple of Venus at Hierapolis, of which Lucian speaks as an
eye-witness, “adveniunt pisces exornati auro.” This practice is, and
has been, world-wide. “Fishes though little have long ears,” is an old
Chinese proverb. “In Japan fish are summoned to dinner by melodious
gongs. In India, I have seen them called out of the muddy depths of the
river at Dohlpore by the ringing of a handbell, while carp in Belgium
answer at once to the whistle of the monks who feed them, and in far
away Otaheite, the chiefs have pet eels, whom they whistle to the
surface” (Robinson, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 14). Cf. Athen., VIII. 3, “and I
myself and very likely many of you too have seen eels having golden and
silver earrings, taking food from any one who offered it to them.” The
Egyptians similarly adorned their crocodiles with gold earrings. Herod. 2. 69.</p></div>

<p>What fish Columella meant by <i>Aurata</i> is not settled: it is
certainly <i>not</i> the “gold-fish,” as some translate, for they are not
sea-fish. Facciolati, after saying that the name came from the fish
having golden eyebrows, goes on that “some folk deny that he can be
identified with the ‘gilthead’ or ‘dory.’” Perhaps the fish is one of
the <i>Sparidæ</i> group, which pass at certain seasons of the year from the
Mediterranean into salt-water fish marshes, as observed by Aristotle,
and confirmed by M. Duhamel. Or can it be the smelt?</p>

<p>Faber, pp. 37, 38, “of fresh-water fishes, twenty-one species, among
them the fresh-water Perch, are also common to the sea: amongst the sea
fishes, the flounder frequents brackish water, and sometimes enters
the rivers: others only occasionally frequent the lagoons and brackish
waters, among them the Gilthead,” a statement incidentally confirmed
by Martial (<i>Ep.</i> XIII. 90) in his helluous <i>pronunciamento</i>, that
practically the only really good <i>Aurata</i> was that whose haunt was
the Lucrine lake, and whose whole world was its oyster! of which fish
Martial (XIII. 90) seems only appreciative,</p>

were (according to Arist., <i>N. H.</i>, VIII. 19) “just about sunrise and

The fact is that at these times fishes are particularly weak-sighted”

Chapter), probably in Sumerian, and certainly in Hebrew, the word
equalling hook, in its primary sense equals thorn, which strongly
suggests, if it do not absolutely prove, that the ancients employed,
as do even now the catchers of flat fish in Essex, and the Indians in
Arizona, a thorn as their primitive hook. In Latin <i>hamus</i> signifies
hook and thorn. Cf. Ovid (<i>Nux.</i>, 113-116).</p></div>

Weapons</i> (London, 1917), p. 37 f.: “The European fish-hooks do not
appear before the <i>fonderia</i> age: in Greece and Roman Italy hooks are
common.” G. Lafaye, in Daremberg and Saglio, <i>op. cit.</i>, III. 8. <i>s.v.</i>
“hamus,” gives figure 3696, a simple bronze hook, figure 3697, a small
double hook in the Museum at Naples, figure 3698, a quadruple hook
(four bronze barbs attached to the angles of a square plate of lead),
and figure 3699, a bronze <i>hamus catenatus</i>. H. B. Walters—<i>Catalogue
of the Bronzes, Greek, Roman, and Etruscan in British Museum</i> (London,
1899), Nos. 38 and 39—describes, but does not figure, two hooks of the
Mycenæan period from Rhodes, 2 inches and 2<small><sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub></small>
inches long, which are dated about 1450 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>

The fisherman on the Mosaic from the Hall of the Mystæ in Melos (R. C.
Bosanquet, in the <i>Jour. of Hellenic Studies</i> (1898), xviii. 60 ff.,
Pl. 1) appears to have been using a glass bottle half-filled with wine
as a lure. The inscription ΜΟΝΟΝ ΜΗ ΥΔΩΡ is generally taken to be late
Greek for “Everything here except water” (which will be supplied by the
next rainfall). But the words might be legitimately rendered: “Only
let no water be used”—a natural exclamation from the devotees of the
wine-god! Prof. Bosanquet, despite his fine sense of humour, has missed
the <i>double entendre</i>.</p></div>

With one method of fishing the ancients (in common with nearly all the
moderns) were unfamiliar. The <i>locus</i> is off Catalina Island, etc.: the

attracted. See <i>antea</i>, p. 41, note 3.</p></div>

But in confirmation of “this statement of Ælian,” Badham, had he taken
the trouble, could have found several others by that and other authors.
Thus Ælian, XVII. 18, of the Sea-roach. <i>Ibid.</i>, VI. 31, of the Crab,
which on hearing the flute and singing would not only quit the sea, but
follow the retreating singer to dry land, and capture! Ælian, VI. 32,
of the <i>Thrissa</i> states that it was caught by singing to it, and by the
noise of shell clappers which induced the fish to dance itself into the
Nets and boats. Cf. also Athenæus, VII. 137, where the <i>Trichias</i> is so
delighted with singing and dancing, that when it hears music it leaps
out of the sea and is enticed on land! Cf. also Herodotus, I. 141,
for the story of Cyrus likening the Ionians to dancing fish. Not only
were there fish that delighted in music and singing, like the dolphin
(Pliny, IX. 8, musicæ arti, mulcetur symphoniæ cantu, sed præcipue
hydrauli sono), but according to Philostephanus there were others, that
themselves made music, like the <i>Poeciliæ</i>, who “sang like thrushes”
(cf. Pliny, XI. 112). Of singing fish Pausanias, VIII. 21. 2, says,
“among the fish in the Aroanius are the so-called spotted fish: they
say that they sing like a thrush. I saw them after they were caught,
but I did not hear them utter a sound, though I tarried by the river
till sunset, when they were said to sing most.”</p></div>

The shark finds great favour among the negroes; “you can swallow him
in de dark,” is a commendation based on the absence of small tricky
bones, such as the shad’s. But to the best black <i>gourmets</i>, the fish
only attains its highest perfection in soup, after being buried for
two weeks! The cook of the friend with whom I was staying in Jamaica
only consented to cutting up my shark, on condition that if a gold
watch was found in its belly, that was to be her perquisite—a condition
postulated, I eventually discovered, because on a similar occasion one
hundred years before, her grandmother <i>did</i> discover a gold watch. Alas
for her! two ship-bolts of iron were her only treasure-trove.</p></div>

“Bobbing for eels,” with a bunch of worms on worsted is of like

Contrast with the Greeks and Romans the abstention from the <i>Murænidæ</i>
by the Egyptians, Jews, Mussulmans, and Highlanders; in the case of the
last, however, the abstention was due to no religious injunction but to
physical loathing.</p>

<p>Fuller on the derivation of the Isle of Ely is too quaint to omit:
“When the priests of this part of the country would still retain their
wives in spite of what Pope and monks could do to the contrary, their
wives and children were miraculously turned into eels, whence it had
the name of Ely. I consider it a lie.” That Ely is derived from the
abundance of Eels taken there has the ancient authority of <i>Liber
Eliensis</i> (II. 53). J. B. Johnston, <i>The Place-Names of England and
Wales</i> (London, 1915), p. 250, takes <i>Ely</i> to mean the “eel-island.” He
adds, however, that Skeat regarded <i>Elge</i>, Bede’s spelling of the name,
as “eel-region,” the second element in the compound, <i>ge</i>, being a very
rare and early Old English word for “district” (cf. German, <i>Gau</i>).
Isaac Taylor, <i>Names and Histories</i> (London, 1896), <i>s.v.</i> Ely, states
that rents were there paid in Eels.</p></div>

Care must be taken to distinguish between the Eel, ἔγχελυς, of the
Greeks, <i>Anguilla</i> of the Romans, and the so-called Lamprey, μύραινα,
or <i>Muræna</i>. Although both belong to the large family of <i>Murænidæ</i>,
the <i>Muræna</i> is usually a much smaller fish, seldom over 2½ feet long.
In shape and general appearance it closely resembles the Eel, but
can be differentiated by its teeth and certain spots over the body.
It becomes very corpulent, so much so that in late life it is unable
to keep its back under water: it is easier to flay, and whiter of
flesh than its relative. Apart from its mating with the viper, and
its tendency (<i>teste</i> Columella) to go mad, its chief characteristics
are greed and fierceness of attack. The second book of Oppian has two
really spirited pictures of its fight with, and conquest of, the Cuttle
fish, and of its rush at, but eventual defeat by, the Lobster. At
Athens the Eel, at Rome the Muræna, was the favourite.</p></div>

Athenæus, XII. 15 and 20. If the fish found favour helluously,
medically condemnation attended it. Hippocrates warns against its
use; Seneca, <i>Nat. Qu.</i>, III. 19, 3, terms it “gravis cibus.” If to
the gastronomic virtues of the <i>Murænidæ</i> both Greeks and Latins were
more than kind, to other characteristics they were far indeed from
blind—<i>e.g.</i> their slipperiness, etc., was proverbial. See Lucian,
<i>Anach.</i>, I, and Plautus, <i>Pseud.</i>, II. 4, 57. Further, did the fish
but hap in a dream, then good-bye to all hopes and desires, which
slipped away, as surely as Alice’s “slithy toves did gyre and gimble
in the wabe.” See Artemidorus, <i>Oneirocritica</i>, II. 14. The phallic
character of the fish prevalent in ancient times continues in modern
Italy, <i>e.g.</i> the proverbs (1) about holding an Eel by his tail, and
(2) that when it has taken the hook, it must go where it is drawn. De
Gubernatis, <i>op. cit.</i>, II. 341.</p></div>

of all fish do not float when dead. Aristotle, who (<i>N. H.</i>, VIII.
2) is, as usual, his authority, confines himself to noting this
characteristic as not possessed “by the majority of fish,” and accounts
for it by the smallness of stomach, lack of water in it, and want of
fat; he states, however, that when fat they do float.</p></div>

It is curious to find that a similar belief was held in Sardinia:
according to Jacoby, the water beetle (<i>Dytiscus roeselii</i>) is there
believed to be the progenitor of the Eel, and is accordingly called the
“Mother of the Eels” (Turrell, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 37).</p></div>

J. Schmidt found the youngest known stages of <i>Leptocephalus</i>, the
larval stage of eels, to the west of the Azores, where the water is
over 2000 fathoms deep: they were one-third of an inch in length and so
were probably not long hatched.</p></div>

Any apparent resemblance in this list, or in this book, to Badham’s
book is easily accounted for by the fact that both derive much from the
same source, he without any, I with due acknowledgment to the little
known volume by Nonnius (Antwerp, 1616), which itself draws largely
from Athenæus, Xenocrates, etc. The sequence of sentences, turns of
expression, choice of epithets in Badham sometimes so strongly suggest
Nonnius, that it is a case of yet another miracle of unconscious
absorption—from a rare book written in Latin 238 years previously!—or
of—well, Ælianism. I hesitated for a long time from even hinting such
unacknowledged extraction by an author to whom two generations have
owed much pleasure and more knowledge. Were it not for the inadequacy
of his references and for his bursting, Wegg-like, into poetry, which
doubles the length and sometimes obscures the sense of the original
Greek or Latin, Badham would be delightful reading.</p></div>

however much disputed. C. Mayhoff prints <i>contra quam in nando meant</i>.

the wind and tide, not minding the erection or opening of the scales,
which do not lie towards the tail, as in other fish.”</p></div>

With this meeting compare that summoned post-haste by Nero in the
Revolution (which led to his death), when to anxious and breathless
senators he imparted the important news that he had just effected an
improvement of the hydraulic organ, by which the notes were made to
sound louder and sweeter. His ἐξεύρηκα conflicts somewhat with the
account in Suetonius (<i>Nero</i>, 41). The Emperor evidently had a bent
and a liking for mechanical invention, for according to C. M. Cobern,
<i>New Archæological Discoveries</i>, etc., 1917, in one of his palaces were
elevators which ran from the ground to the top floor, and a circular
dining-room which revolved with the sun.</p></div>

The part played by fish in recovering episcopal keys and rings has been
dwelt on elsewhere. Sad it is that in the case of St. Lupus the <i>rôle</i>
is performed not by his namesake fish, but by a barbel, in whose belly
was found, just previous to the return of the bishop to his See of
Sens the self-same ring which on being exiled by Clothaire II. he had
cast into the moat. Let us, disregarding all geographical habitats,
trust that Barbel was here an ichthyic inexactitude for <i>Lupus</i>. Cf.

The <i>toga prætexta</i> was worn by the higher magistrates,
certain priests, and free-born children. Isidorus, in <i>Gloss.</i>,
“Anguilla est qua coercentur in scholis pueri,” and Pliny, <i>N. H.</i>,
IX., 39, “eoque verberari solitos tradit Verrius prætextatos.”
Under the old law <i>prætextati</i> were unamerceable; <i>non in ære, sed
in cute solvebant</i>! Our Saxon forbears adopted the whip of eels;
see Fosbroke, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 303. Rabelais (II. 30) continues the
tradition—“Whereupon his master gave him such a sound thrashing with
an <i>eel-skin</i>, that his own would have been worth nought for bagpipes.”</p></div>

Badham (plagiarising Blaikie), on p. 364—in “Galen, Xenocrates,
Diphilus speak disparagingly of the Sole,” is inaccurate. Xenocrates
terms its flesh indigestible. Galen states that it is quite the
reverse, and commends it highly as a diet. Diphilus does not hesitate
to declare that the Sole affords abundant nourishment and is most
pleasing to the taste. Cf. Nonnius, p. 89. In the case of a Sole with
its customarily modest dimensions it is not easy to hearken unto the
command, which was laid down in the twelfth century for the benefit of
Robert, the so-called King of England, “Anglorum Regi scripsit schola
tota Salerni,” by “the Schoole of Salernes most learned and juditious
Directorie, of Methodicall Instructions for the guide and governing the

The belief in fish as curatives of not only human but also animal
ailments still lingers. In this very year, 1920, we read in <i>The

push down the throat of a cow, that had just calved but was suffering
from hæmorrhage. In consequence, or in spite of the trout, the cow recovered.</p></div>

The influence of fish, wherever important, in commerce is noteworthy.
They furnished, as we have seen, designs for a mint or <i>cognomina</i> for
Roman Nobles. An interesting and probably very ancient instance occurs
in the oath taken this very year (1920) by the Stipendiary Magistrate
of Douglas, Isle of Man: “I swear to do justice between party and
party, as indifferently as the herring’s backbone doth lie in the midst
of the fish.”</p></div>

removing hindrances to navigation, not to ascending fish.</p></div>

<i>Op. cit.</i>, IV. 16. In his palinode, of which a few lines (<i>frag.</i> 32,
Bergk<sup>4</sup>) are extant, Stesichorus asserts that it was not
Helen herself, but only her semblance or wraith, which Paris carried
off to Troy. Greeks and Trojans slew one another for a mere phantom,
while the real Helen never left Sparta. Hdt., 2, 112 ff., gives a
rather different turn to the story. According to him, Helen eloped
from Sparta with Paris, but was driven back by a storm to Egypt, where
Paris told lies and was punished by Proteus. Euripides in his <i>Helena</i>
combines the two versions. Like Stesichorus, he makes the truant a
mere phantom, an ‘eloping angel.’ Like Herodotus, he sends the real
Helen to Egypt. Menelaus, who, escorting the phantom home from Troy,
arrives in Egypt, is there confronted with the real Helen and is sadly
puzzled. Just as he begins to think himself a bigamist, the misty Helen evaporates!</p></div>

<p>The data for this essay had been collected and half of it
written, when I heard of an article on <i>Ancient Egyptian Fishing</i> by
Mr. Oric Bates, in <i>Harvard African Studies</i>, Cambridge, Massachusetts,
1917. While somewhat disappointed of not being the first to write in
English on the subject, I was quickly reconciled by the fact that the
task had fallen to an experienced Egyptologist, whose monograph, while
making necessary the recasting of this chapter, bequeathed to me some
new, if not always convincing theories, and much technical and other
data, the frequent use of which I gladly acknowledge.</p></div>

Bates holds (244) that the bident was only used by the nobles, and
never by the professional fisherman, who employed nets, lines, traps,
etc., but never the bident. He sees an analogy in the throwing sticks
used by the nobles in the Old Kingdom fowling scenes, “whereas
the peasants appear to have taken birds only by traps or clapnets.”</p></div>

Fish hieroglyphs are regarded by some as general determinatives for
words meaning “shame,” “evil,” etc. (cf. Plutarch, <i>op. cit.</i>, 32), and
by others as merely phonetic determinatives (cf. Montet, <i>op. cit.</i>, p.
48). That fish were regarded as either enemies or emblems of enemies of
the gods and of the kings would seem to be borne out by the ceremony
annually performed at Edfu, where the festival calendar contains the
following: “Fish are thrown on the ground, and all the priests hack
and hew them with knives, saying ‘Cut ye wounds on your bodies, kill
ye one another: Ra triumphs over his enemies, Horus of Edfu over all
evil ones.’” The text assures us that “the meaning of the ceremony
is to achieve the destruction of the enemies of the gods and king.”

These offerings (15,500 dressed, 2,200 white fish, etc.) are named
under the heading, “Oblations of the festivals which the King founded
for his Father Amon-Re.” But in the summary of the good deeds wrought
for the gods by Rameses III.—“I founded for them divine offerings
of barley, wheat, wine, incense, fruit, cattle and fowl”—observe
the complete silence as to <i>fish</i>, because these offerings were to
the gods, not to the temples. Cf. Breasted, <i>Ancient Records</i>, IV.,

The story of the <i>trochilus</i>, with which alone out of all birds and
beasts our author states the crocodile lives in amity, because the
little bird enters its mouth (when on land) and frees it from myriads
of devouring leeches, is too well known for reference, were it not for
the dispute (<i>a</i>) as to whether the bird—<i>Pluvianus egyptius</i>—performs
any service except uttering a shrill cry on the approach of man
and thus warning the crocodile, and (<i>b</i>) whether for leeches, we
should not substitute gnats. Cf. W. Houghton, <i>N. H. of the Ancients</i>
(London), pp. 238-244. The account of the connection between the bird
and the beast given by Plutarch is far prettier and more spirited than
that of Herodotus.</p></div>

Plutarch, <i>ibid.</i>, 75. The beasts enjoyed both a hereditary
transmission of holiness and a subtle discrimination as to the build of
a boat, for fishermen who embark in one made of papyrus enjoy security
from their attentions, “they having either a fear or else a veneration
for this sort of boat,” because Isis in her search for the remains of
Osiris used such a means of conveyance. Plutarch, <i>ibid.</i>, 18.</p></div>

Crocodiles and <i>Papyri</i> seem a curious juxtaposition!
Some time ago Dr. Grenfell was excavating ground likely to yield
important finds. Bad luck dogged his digging: only preserved crocodiles
came to light. One day a labourer, incensed at work wasted on the
beasts, jabbed his pick into the latest specimen, whose head disgorged
a roll of papyrus. Similar head-smashings were fruitful of results,
most of which belong to the Hearst Collection.</p></div>

The information as to the average prices and weights of the <i>Mugil
capito</i>, on which the above calculations were grounded, was obtained
from the Department of Supplies in Egypt. “In the markets of Alexandria
the weight of the grey mullet varies from 8 to 3 to the <i>oke</i> (2·75
lbs.), say 5½ to 14½ oz. each. The <i>pre-war</i> retail price was for large
fish, 3 or 4 to the <i>oke</i>, 8 <i>Piastres</i>; for small, 8 to the <i>oke</i>,
5 Piastres.” The prices in August, 1920, had increased to 20 and 16
<i>Piastres</i> respectively, or nearly two-thirds more.</p></div>

Aristotle (<i>H. A.</i>, III. 11), states that the hair does
grow in dead bodies. Since his time many descriptions of remarkable
growth after death have been published, and many people believe that
such growth does take place. Erasmus Wilson pronounces that “the
lengthening of the hairs observed in a dead person is merely the result
of the contraction of the skin towards their bulb.”</p></div>

But as one of the earliest instances of imitative magic the story is
notable. In the tale of Overthrowing Apep, based on the XXXIXth Chapter
of <i>The Book of the Dead</i>, the priestly directions for destroying this
enemy of Ra, or the Sun, run as follows: “Thou shalt say a prayer over
a figure of Apep, which hath been drawn upon a sheet of papyrus, and
over a wax figure of Apep upon which his name has been cut: and thou
shalt lay them on the fire, so that it may consume the enemy of Ra.”
Six figures in all, presumably “to mak siccar,” are to be placed on
the fire at stated hours of the day and night. Cf. Theocritus, <i>Id.</i>,
II. 27 ff., where the slighted damsel prays, “Even as I melt this wax,
with the god to aid, so speedily may he (her lover) by love be molten.”</p></div>

Some recent scholars have suggested that in the stories of Polycrates
throwing his ring into the sea, and of Theseus proving his parentage by
a like sacrifice, we should detect traces of an early custom, by which
the maritime king married the sea-goddess—a custom perpetuated in the
symbolical union between the Doges of Venice and the Adriatic. This
ingenious hypothesis was first worked out by S. Reinach, “Le Mariage
avec la mer,” in <i>Revue archéologique</i> (1905), ii. 1 ff. (= <i>id.</i>
<i>Cultes, Mythes, et Religions</i>, Paris, (1906), ii. 266 ff.).</p></div>

attached. Cf. <i>Élite des monuments Céramographiques</i>, vol. III., Plate I.</p></div>

From the find (made during the war by a Sikh regiment on the Tigris
above Samara) of an alabaster vase (now in the Ashmolean Museum), which
from archæological reasons must be placed among the very earliest
remnants of Sumerian civilisation, it is evident that—given the
discovery was <i>in situ</i>—the frontiers of the Sumerian Empire must have
extended much farther north than has been hitherto generally supposed.
Owing to the deposits of the two rivers, the sea has receded some
hundred and twenty miles.</p></div>

Petrie (<i>Egypt and Israel</i> (London, 1911), p. 15): “The Turanian race

Euphrates valley for some thousands of years and produced a strong
commercial and mathematical culture. The wandering Semite had at last
been drawn into this settled system of life.”</p></div>

The carved ivory handle of a flint knife in the Louvre proves
(according to Petrie) that the art of slate-palettes in Egypt
originated from Elamite civilisation, which flourished before its
rise. It must be of prehistoric age, yet shows a well-developed art
with Mesopotamian or Elamite affinities earlier than the sculptured
slate-palettes and maceheads. M. G. Bénédite (<i>Monuments Pict.</i>) holds
that in this knife-handle we have the most tangible evidence yet
found of a connection in <i>very early</i> times between the Egyptian and
Mesopotamian civilisations. King (<i>Jour. Egypt. Archæology</i>, vol. IV.,
p. 64) suggests that there was a connection with Babylonian-Elamite
seals from Susa.</p></div>

Thus the general conception of pictographic writing might perhaps be
borrowed from the Euphrates valley, but not a single sign taken from
the Babylonian script can be found (W. Max Müller, <i>Encly. Bibl.</i>,
p. 1233). Dr. Alan Gardiner, on the origin of the Semitic and Greek
alphabets, concludes that the evidence does point to the alphabet being
Semitic in origin and based upon acrophonic picture signs (<i>Journal of
Egyptian Archæology</i>, vol. III., p. 1).</p></div>

The Babylonian legend of Adapa is thus known to have circulated in
Palestine and Egypt before the Hebrew Exodus. The story of Adapa is
thought by some to have influenced the Hebrew version of the story of
Adam and Eve and the loss of Paradise. See the excellent discussion
in T. Skinner, <i>Genesis</i> (in the <i>International Critical Commentary</i>
(1912), p. 91 ff), and Langdon, <i>The Sumerian Epic of Paradise</i>

Rameses II. was held in high esteem as a rain-maker—perhaps rain-god—as
is evidenced by the sacrifices offered by the Hittites that their
princess should on her journey to Egypt to marry Rameses enjoy fair
weather, despite that it was the season of the winter storms. In
consequence of this power over the elements, the Hittite chiefs
strongly advocated friendship with Egypt, as otherwise Rameses II.
would probably stop rain and cause a famine in their country (Breasted,
<i>Ancient Records</i>, III. 423, 426).</p></div>

We sometimes find with an army crossing a river, as delineated in the
sculptures, each soldier with the skin beneath his belly and paddling
with his legs and arms, but retaining in his mouth one of the legs of
the skin, into which he blows as into a bagpipe. The act of paddling
across a big river, like the Euphrates, would of itself need all
his breath; but King points out that the sculptor, in the spirit of
primitive art, which, diffident of its own powers of portrayal or
distrusting the imagination of the beholder, seeks to make its object
clear by conventional devices, wishes to indicate that the skins are
not solid bodies, and can find no better way of showing it than by
making his swimmers continue blowing out the skins.</p></div>

In each case Esarhaddon “cut off his head.” Both heads were sent to
Nineveh for exhibition. Asur-bani-pal was a greater specialist in
heads than his father: the head of any foe whom he particularly hated
or feared, such as Teumann of Elam, was preserved by some method, and
hung conspicuously in the famed gardens of the palace. A sculptured
representation hands down the scene to us. The king reclines on an
elevated couch under an arbour of vines: his favourite queen is seated
on a throne at the foot of the couch: both are raising wine cups to
their lips: many attendants ply the inevitable fly-flappers, while at
a distance musicians are ranged. Birds play and flutter among the palm
and cypress trees; from one dangles Teumann’s head on which the eyes
of the king are gloating. Such is the picture drawn by de Razogin,
<i>Ancient Assyria</i> (London, 1888).</p></div>

In the Neo-Babylonian period the word, which makes its first appearance
in this contract, employed for <i>net</i> appears to have been <i>salītu</i>
or <i>lītu</i>. The word is written <i>sa-li-tum</i>, and the first syllable
(<i>sa</i>) may be either part of the word, or else the determinative
<i>riksu</i>, which is written before things made of cordage. If the word
be read <i>salītu</i>, it may perhaps be derived from the root, <i>salû</i>, <i>to
immerse</i>. The rendering of the word as <i>net</i> is not quite certain, but,
as will be seen from the translation of the text, the context points to
this meaning. It is clearly some sort of tackle used by fishermen, and
the most obvious meaning would be net.</p></div>

In noting the attributes ascribed to various gods, we are confronted
by the problem as to what suggested to the Babylonian his precise
differentiation in their characters. These betray their origin: they
are the personification of natural forces: in other words, the gods
and many of the stories told of them are the only explanation the
Babylonian could give, after centuries of observation, of the forces
and changes in the natural world. In company with other primitive
peoples he explained them as the work of beings very similar but
superior to himself. See King, <i>Babylonian Religion</i> (London, 1889).
This inevitable tendency of anthropomorphism was tersely expressed by
Xenophanes of Colophon (<i>frag.</i> 15):—</p>

demi-god, attended by two gods of fecundity, on whom the Sun-god with a
fish tail looks down benignantly. Forlong’s obsession detects in every
representation, Indian or Irish, Assyrian or Australasian, some emblem
of fecundity, while his ever-present “King Charles’s head” is some
phallic symbol. We are almost reminded of the witty quatrain current

There was a Babylonian god Dagan whose name appears in conjunction with
Anu and often with Ninurta (Ninib). Whether the Philistine Dagon is
the same as the Babylonian Dagan cannot with our present knowledge be
determined. The long and profound influence of Babylonia in Palestine
in early times makes it quite possible that Dagon, like Anath, came
thence. <i>Ency. Bibl.</i>, p. 984. No evidence suggests Dagan as a
Babylonian fish-god.</p>

<p>Some authorities now hold that Dagan came to Babylonia with
the Amoritic invasion towards the latter half of the third millennium.</p></div>

Oannes of Berosus is identified with Enki (otherwise Ea) by Langdon,

Manco Capac and Mama Ocllo, the children of the sun god, rose, however,
not from the sea, but from <i>Lake</i> Titicaca, when they brought to the
ancient Peruvians government, law, a moral code, art, and science.

see also figs. 199, 661. The large number of seals, almost entirely
cylinder, which have been found in the excavations is probably owing to
every Assyrian of any means always carrying one hung on him. The use to
which they were put was precisely similar to that of our signet ring.
An Assyrian, instead of signing a document, ran his cylinder over the
damp clay tablet on which the deed he was attesting had been inscribed.
No two cylinder seals were absolutely alike, and thus this method
of signature worked very well. The work on the cylinders is always
intaglio; the subjects represented are very various, including emblems
of the gods, animals, fish, etc.</p></div>

From Karl Frank, <i>Babylonische Beschwörtunge Reliefs</i>, p. 80. The South
Wind was specially dreaded, because it caused destructive floods in
the low-lying regions of the Euphrates valley. In Langdon’s <i>Sumerian
Epic of Paradise</i> (<i>op. cit.</i>, 1915), p. 41, we find that “Adapa
sailed to catch fish, <i>the trade of Eridu</i>,” a pretty and simple touch
identifying the god with his worshippers, and his pursuit with their
trade; and one which supports the theory that to the Babylonian his
god, in early times, was a being very similar to himself, if more powerful.</p></div>

Adapa stands out as a pathetic and cruelly-punished figure. In this,
one of the prettiest of the clumsy legends by which mankind tried to
explain the loss of eternal life, Ea forbids for selfish reasons his
eating or drinking of <i>the Bread or Water of Life</i>, while Anu’s offer
of immortality springs from his desire to deprive Ea, whom he suspects
of having betrayed to Adapa the celestial secrets of magical science,
of his devotee and fish-gatherer.</p></div>

Keller, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 347, is astray in stating that Ea was regarded

therein, but apart from this, there is no evidence that he was termed,
even with a wide use of the word, a Fish God.</p></div>

For the omission of fish from the cargo of Noah’s ark, Whiston in his
philosophic <i>A New Theory of the Deluge</i> (London, 1737), accounts by
the fact, that fish, living in a cooler, more equable element, were
correcter in their lives than beasts and birds, who from the heat
or cold on land engendered by the sun or its absence were prone to
excesses of passion or exercises of sin, and so were saved!</p></div>

Langdon’s <i>Le Poème Sumérien</i> (Paris, 1919) is to be found much, which
is not written in the later account of Adapa and of the Flood, and of
Paradise, and many details which are different. <i>In it there is no
woman, no temptress, no serpent.</i> But it does record that the survivor
of the Flood was placed in a garden and apparently forbidden to eat of
the fruit of a tree, growing in the centre of the garden. He does eat,
however, and thereby loses immortality.</p></div>

The myth of the Deluge is practically world-wide, except in Africa
(including Egypt), “where native legends of a great flood are
conspicuously absent—indeed, no clear case of one has yet been
reported.” J. G. Frazer, <i>Folklore in the Old Testament</i> (London,
1918), vol. I. p. 40. Maspero seems quite wide of the mark in treating
the semi-ritual myth of the Destruction of Man as “a dry deluge myth,”

of the Deluge, see Hastings, <i>Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics</i>,

‘Dolphin’ is the translation of <i>Nakhiri</i>, doubtless from the same

Mediterranean, I suggested to Professor King an alternative rendering
of <i>nakhiri</i> as ‘whale,’ and he informed me he accepts my suggestion as

carriers or permanent attendants. But see p. 53 of the Introduction to
<i>The Annals of the Kings of Assyria</i>, <i>op. cit.</i> Dr. St. Clair Tisdall
writes: “If <i>Nam-su-hu</i> (Budge and King’s translation) be right, it is
evidently the Egyptian name ’<i>msuhu</i> = crocodile, with the plural <i>Na</i>

The Assyrians, probably from having no admixture of the softer Sumerian

Lewysohn’s (<i>Zool. d. Talmud</i>, 248, as quoted by Keller, <i>op. cit.</i>,

by the Persians <i>Ufratus</i>, which became when borrowed by the Greeks,

“In Israel not to be buried was a terrible disgrace which one could
hardly wish for one’s enemy: the spirits of the unburied wandered
restlessly about. Burial alone so bound the spirit to the body that it
had rest and could harm no one.” Cheyne’s assertion in <i>Encyl. Bibl.</i>
(<i>op. cit.</i>), p. 1041, seems to me hardly warranted, at any rate by
the O.T. passages which he adduces in support of this statement, in
attributing to Israel the idea of the unburied dead being condemned
to miserable wandering. For the Greek conception see <i>inter alia</i> the
<i>Antigone</i> of Sophocles.</p></div>

See Egyptian <i>Book of the Dead</i> (London, 1910), ch. LIII., with
reference to the deceased being obliged, from lack of proper food in
the under-world, to eat filth—“Let me not be obliged to eat thereof
in place of the sepulchral offerings.” To provide food for the dead,
asphodel was planted near tombs (<i>Odyssey</i>, XI. 539 and 573) by the
Greeks. From Hesiod (<i>Op.</i> 41) we learn that the <i>roots</i> of the
asphodel were eaten as a common vegetable, as was the mallow. Merry
states that in the Greek islands, where customs linger longer than on
the mainland, this “kind of squill is still planted on graves.” If the
Homeric ‘mead of asphodel’ turns out, as some editors maintain, to have
had a strictly utilitarian significance, how many poets and poetasters
have mistaken ‘greens’ for ‘greenery!’</p></div>

saliva, we can settle at once the most primitive method of sorcery

Cf. with those of Moses and Sargon the stories of Gilgamesh King of
Babylon (Ælian, XII. 22), of Semiramis Queen of Assyria (Diodorus
Siculus, ii. 4), and of Karna in the Indian Epic of Mahabharata
(Cheyne’s <i>Traditions and Beliefs of Ancient Israel</i> London, 1907),
p. 519. “It has been conjectured,” writes Frazer (<i>op. cit.</i>), II. p.
454 ff, “that in stories like that of the exposure of Moses in the
water (in this case, unlike most others, all supernatural elements are
absent) we have a reminiscence of the old custom as practised by the
Celtæ on the Rhine, and according to Speke by some Central African
tribes in the last century, of testing the legitimacy of children by
throwing them into the water to sink or swim; the infants which sank
were rejected as bastards. In the light of this conjecture it may be
significant that in several of these stories the birth of the child is
represented as supernatural, which in this connection cynics are apt to
regard as a delicate synonym for illegitimate.” On p. 454 he touches on
the question whether Moses, the son of Amram by his (Amram’s) paternal
<i>aunt</i>, was thus the offspring of an incestuous marriage, and therefore
exposed on the Nile.</p></div>

From Astronomy many Assyrian dates have been ascertained. Kugler
by stellar researches has settled the vexed question of the date
of Hammurabi, and probably that of Abram, at about 2120 <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span>, which unites within one year the latest
conclusions of King, Jastrow, and Rogers, and so establishes an
important degree of accord among Assyriologists on events subsequent
to 2200 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> as regards which they have
hitherto been wide apart. Then again modern astronomers have worked
out that there was a total eclipse of the sun at Nineveh on June 15,
763 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> The importance of the fixing of
this date can as regards Assyrian chronology hardly be exaggerated. The
Assyrians, rejecting the Babylonian system of counting time, invented
a system of their own, by naming the year after certain officers or
terms of office, not unlike the system of the Archonates at Athens,
and the Consulates at Rome. These were termed <i>limus</i>: a list of
these functionaries during four centuries has come down to us. In the
time of one of them, Pur Sagali, there is a mention of the eclipse of
the sun. As this eclipse has now been fixed for the year 763 <span
class="smcap">b.c.</span>, we possess an automatic date for every year
after of the <i>limus</i>.</p></div>

Apollo to the Greeks was at once archer-god and god of divination. The
word ἀγεῖλε, “he gave as his oracular response,” means literally “he
picked up” (the arrows). Indeed the curious fact that λέγω in Greek
denotes “I say” and in Latin “I read” is best explained by O. Schrader,
who points out that it meant originally “I pick up” or “collect” (the
arrows of divination) and so both read and declare the will of heaven.

The <i>Biru</i> or <i>Kasbu</i> represented the distance walked by
an ordinary man in one Sumerian hour, which, as they divided their
whole day into twelve, equals two of our hours. The prehistoric
Sumerians, like other nations, reckoned the year by the Moon, not by
the Sun. The historic calendar-makers endeavoured to bridge the hiatus
and correlate the solar with the lunar year by inserting an intercalary
month. They combined the decimal and the sexagesimal in their scheme of
numbers—hence, though curiously, their multiplication was always by
six, not ten. Cf. W. Zimmern, <i>Zeit und Raumrechnung</i>, who instances
the twelve—6 × 2—signs of the Zodiac, etc.</p></div>

After acknowledging (<i>Notes and Queries</i>, Dec. 2, 1916) that there is
no mention in either Old or New Testament of a Rod, Mr. Breslar goes
on, “Yet there are places such as Job xl. 31 (xli. 7) where the Hebrew
words are translated barbed irons and fish spears, and in Job xl.
26 (xli. 2) a thorn. A fishing-rod in the modern sense no one could
reasonably demand, though I opine that in <i>agmoun</i> (Isaiah lviii. 5),
used in that sense in Job xl. 26, we have the nucleus of one.” Mr.
Breslar is evidently not aware or does not realise that fish spears,
bidents, etc., were of the earliest weapons of fishing, long anterior
to the Rod, and that these are the weapons referred to in Job. A
reference to the <i>Jewish Encyclopædia</i> edited by Isidore Singer, would
have shown him that <i>ẓilẓal dagim</i> in Job xli. 7 was in all probability
a harpoon. Then, “that this phrase (<i>Klei metzooda</i>) or a similar one
is not found in the Bible is merely an accidental omission like, I
believe, that of the name of Jehovah from the Book of Esther.” This is
hardly helpful: let us grant that the omission of a name from a short
book like Esther was an accident. How can this be “like” the omission
of all mention of or allusion to the Rod in the vast literature of
the Old and New Testaments and of the Talmud, especially when we find
in all three numerous passages dealing with fishing and the tackle
employed for fishing?</p></div>

At the beginning of the world (Buddha tells the Monk of Jetavana) all
the fishes chose Leviathan for their King. No hint as to what fish
this Leviathan represented is given us: but the Leviathan conceived
by the Talmudists seems to have been an indefinable sea-monster, of
which the female lay coiled round the earth till God, fearing that her
progeny might destroy the new globe, killed her and salted her flesh
and put it away for the banquet which at the end awaits the pious of
the earth. On that day Gabriel will kill the male also, and make a tent
out of his skin for the Elect who are bidden to the banquet (Robinson,
<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 8). As Robinson is somewhat misleading, especially as
regards the word Leviathan, I give the story as told by Buddha with
reference to Anqulimāta from <i>Jātaka</i>, nv. 537, vol. V. p. 462. A
certain king had been a Yakkha, and still wanted to eat human flesh.
His commander-in-chief tells him a tale to warn him. “Once upon a time
there were great fishes in the Ocean. One of them, Ānanda, was made
king of all the fish, ate the other fish, and finally ate his own tail
thinking it was a fish. The remaining fish smelling blood, devoured
Ānanda’s tail until they reached his head, and all that was left of
Ānanda was a heap of bones.” Leviathan is a gloss of Robinson’s,
because the only word in the text which could in any degree correspond
to Leviathan is <i>Mahā Maccho</i> = great fish. For the election of a King
of fish, see also the <i>Naĉĉa Jātaka</i>, and <i>the Ubrīda Jātaka</i>.</p></div>

The inscription mentions the existing conditions of foreign affairs
with neighbouring countries as satisfactory. It is in this connection
that the “people of Israel” come in. Their Exodus, according to
Pharaonic fashion, would have been described by the King as an
expulsion and not as an escape against his will. The author of the
inscription, who wrote from a point of view which was not that of the
Biblical account, seems not unsupported by Exodus xii. 39, “Because
they were thrust out of Egypt and could not tarry.” Even stronger
is the Revised Version marginal rendering in Exodus xi. 1, “When he
shall let you go altogether, he shall utterly thrust you out hence.”

In connection with, perhaps even helping to fix, the date of the
Exodus, it is in the victorious hymn of Menephtah that the earliest
written reference to Israel appears: “Israel is desolated: her seed is
not. Palestine has become a (defenceless) widow of Egypt” (Breasted),
or “The Israelites are swept off: his seed is no more” (Naville).
Petrie’s translation, “The people of Israel is spoiled: it has no corn
(or seed),” does not for various reasons seem to find favour. The
majority of Egyptologists now identify Aahmes I. with the “new king who
knew not Joseph,” <i>c.</i> (1582), Rameses II. as the first Pharaoh of the
Oppression, and of Exodus ii. 15 (<i>c.</i> 1300), and Menephtah the son of
Rameses II. with the Pharaoh of the Plagues and the Flight from Egypt

a battle mid safer surroundings, for in representations the head
keepers are seen letting the lions, etc., out of cages for their

preserved by both Assyrian and Persian rulers; in England for several

The classification, if unscientific and incorrect—<i>e.g.</i>
Eels possess rudimentary scales—had as its practical purpose the
elimination of the <i>Siluridæ</i>—<i>i.e.</i> the Catfish <i>Clarias</i>, <i>Bagrus</i>,
<i>Synodontis</i>, etc.—which even if, as with the Catfish, pleasant to
the taste were very unwholesome, causing diarrhœa, rashes, etc.
Doctors inform me that even in our day Jews who eat <i>crustaceæ</i>,
especially lobsters, are far more liable to these diseases than
Christians—presumably from an abstention of centuries. The ban on
Eels from their infrequency in Palestine was almost superfluous, but
on the <i>Clarias</i>, which abounds in and near the sea of Tiberias, very
practical. The abstention, whether originating from supposed reasons
of health or from some obscure tabu, was and still is prevalent in
Asia, Africa, and South America. A curious trace of it at Rome is
discoverable in Numa’s ordinance that in sacrificial offerings no
scaleless fish, and no scarus should figure (Pliny, <i>N. H.</i>, XXXII.
10). The abstention is sometimes merely partial, as with the Karayás in
the Amazon valley, see W. A. Cook, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 96.</p></div>

Walton (in his Introduction) makes Piscator, after speaking of these
four Apostles as “men of mild and sweet, and peaceable spirits (as
indeed most fishermen are),” continues, “it is observable that it is
our Saviour’s will that his four Fishermen Apostles should have a
prioritie of nomination in the catalogue of his Twelve Apostles. And it
is yet more observable that at his Transfiguration, when he left the
rest of his Disciples and chose only three to accompany him, that these
three were all Fishermen.” As a contrast to the excellent character
given to the four fisher Apostles by Walton, a learned divine of Worms,
J. Ruchard, found it incumbent in 1479 to defend Peter from the charge
of instituting abstinence from flesh, so that he could profitably
dispose of his fish! Keller, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 335.</p></div>

shelter of their fathers’ mouths when about the size of a lentil, and
apparently never return.” The male Pipe fish <i>Syngnathus acus</i> not
only carries the eggs, but also the young fish in a pouch, in a manner
similar to the kangaroo. The young, even after they have begun to swim
about, return when alarmed to the parental cavity. There are only one
or two instances of a female fish taking sole charge of the ova: of
these is <i>Aspreto batrachus</i>, which by lying on the top of her eggs
presses them in to her spongy body and carries them thus, till they are hatched.</p></div>

In <i>Some Palestinian Cults in the Greek and Roman Age</i> (Proceedings of
British Academy, vol. V. p. 9), Mr. G. F. Hill, speaking of the worship
in the two cities, concludes that the one at Ascalon is identified by
Herodotus with that of Aphrodite Urania, and that at Gaza with Derceto,
or Atargatis. Lucian (if he wrote <i>De dea Syria</i>) distinguishes the
goddess of Ascalon from her of Hierapolis, who was worshipped in human
not semi-human form, but there is little doubt of the connection
between them. The Greeks identified both with Aphrodite. Other writers
state that the Canaanite Ashtoreth, pre-eminently the goddess of
reproduction and fecundity, became the goddess of fish (which, as
sacred to her, were forbidden food) and of the pomegranate, both of which
from their thousands of eggs or seeds are striking emblems of fertility.</p></div>

Tobit, viii. 4 and 5 (Douai version). The fatuity of his reasoning,
although with seven predecessors slain by the demon much must be
pardoned to Tobias, is obvious, when we discover that the practice of
deferring the consummation of marriage for a certain time is older
than Tobit and Christianity, and has been observed by heathen tribes,
not on any ascetic principle, in many parts of the world. Hence, “we
may reasonably infer that far from instituting the rule and imposing
it on the pagans, the Church, on the contrary, borrowed it (like much
else) from the heathen, and sought to give it a scriptural sanction by
appealing to the authority of the angel Raphael.” Frazer, <i>op. cit.</i>, I. 505.</p></div>

The whole question is fully treated by J. G. Frazer, <i>op. cit.</i>, vol.
I., pp. 485-530, and <i>Adonis, Attis, and Osiris</i>, 3rd ed., vol. I.,
pp. 57-60. Some writers hold that the period of continence originated
at an ancient time when it was deemed advisable that the deflowering
should be effected by a god or his representatives—In Israel the Sacred
Men—so that the woman should receive strength to bear children to
her husband. For the practice they rely on Hosea iv. 14, and for the
deferment to the seventh night on Gen. xxix. 27, and in the correction
of the reading in Judges, xiv. 18, from “before the sun went down” to
“before he went into her chamber.” The evidence to my mind is far from
convincing.</p></div>

It would seem that the Babylonians intelligently, if unconsciously,
anticipated our law of germs, for “the doctrine of disease was that
the swarming demons could enter a man’s body and cause sickness.” On
a fragment of a tablet, Budge has found six evil spirits mentioned by
name, each of which specialised in attack, the first going for the
head, and so on. See <i>Encyc. Bibl.</i>, 1073.</p></div>

an absolute dearth of fish, an eagle suddenly dropped from the clouds

“O True Believers, kill no game while ye are on pilgrimage. It is
lawful for you to fish in the sea and eat what ye shall catch as a
provision for you and for those that travel.” The Koran (Sale, chap.
V. or “on Contracts”). “This passage,” says Jallaleddin, “is to be
understood only of fish which live altogether in the sea, and not of
those which live partly in the sea and partly on land, such as crabs.”
The Turks, who are Hanifites, never eat of the latter class; but some
sects have no scruples.</p></div>

<i>The Compleat Angler</i>, ch. I. “Others say that he left it (the Art
of Angling) engraven on those pillars which he erected to preserve
the knowledge of Mathematicks, Musick, and the rest of those precious
Arts, which by God’s appointment or allowance, and his noble industry
were thereby preserved from perishing in Noah’s Floud.” According
to Manetho, <i>Syncell Chron.</i>, 40, these tables engraved with sacred
characters were translated into the Greek tongue in hieroglyphic
characters, and committed to writing and deposited in the temples
of Egypt. See the <i>Epistle of Manetho, the Sebennyte</i>, to Ptolemæus

<i>Four Poems from Zion’s Flowers</i>, etc., by Mr. Zacharie Boyd, printed
from his manuscripts in the Library of the University of Glasgow,
edited by G. Neil, Glasgow, 1855. Perhaps the Rector’s Muse was
spurred to these heights of poesie by the fact that the arms of the
City of Glasgow bear a salmon with a ring in its mouth, illustrative
of the miracle wrought by St. Kentigern, the founder of the See and
first bishop. At the Reformation the revenue of the church included
one hundred and sixty-eight salmon. See T. Moule, <i>Heraldry of Fish</i>
(London, 1842), pp. 124-5. In the recovery of the keys of cathedrals
and episcopal rings, fish play a part, as the adventures of St. Egwin
(vol. i. 161), of St. Benno (vol. vi. 224), and of St. Maurilius (vol.
x. 188), described by Baring-Gould (<i>op. cit.</i>) all testify.</p></div>

Sale, <i>Sura 38 of the Koran</i>, gives, as regards the incident,
references to: (A) <i>The Talmud</i>, probably to the treatise <i>Gittin</i>,
pp. 68, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>. See <i>Jew. Encycl.</i>, xi. 448, and cf. p. 443<i>b</i>.
(B) <i>En Jacob</i>, Pt. ii.—probably to a work of this title, <i>Well of Jacob</i>,
a collection of legends and parables by Jacob ben Solomon ibn Chabib
from the <i>Babylonian Talmud</i>, 2 vols. (Amsterdam, 1684-85). (C) <i>Yalkut
in lib. Reg.</i>, p. 182—this is a collection of expositions of the O.T.
books and first printed in 1521. Solomon’s throwing of the demon seems
quite justifiable, if Sakhar and Asmodeus were under different names
one and the same, for from <i>Gittin</i>, 68 <i>b</i>, we learn that the demon,
after swallowing Solomon, “<i>spat him a distance of 400 miles</i>,” a
feat in ballistics, or “the art of propelling <i>heavy bodies</i>,” which
surpasses even the German long-range gun.</p></div>

<i>Ibid.</i>, II. 8, ii. (3, 4). Neither the value nor the valour of the
fishes seem worthy of onlookers. Perhaps the husband had invented—China
seems to have anticipated most of our inventions—and was displaying
the Double Spey or Steeple cast. But a rod, like a wedding, invariably
attracts a crowd, as a stroll on the Seine any Sunday will verify. Some
years ago Mr. Kelson and I were trying a new salmon rod, <i>faute de
mieux</i>, from the south bank of the Thames. In ten minutes the Surrey
side of the Waterloo Bridge was black with folk, hoping, perchance, to
witness a capture of the mythical Thames salmon.</p></div>

<i>Op. cit.</i>, but in Japan, especially at Gifu, the cormorant is in
common use, while D. Ross, <i>The Land of Five Rivers and Sindh</i> (London,
1883), states that on the Indus not only the Cormorant (<i>Graculus

Early in the seventeenth century an attempt was made to introduce
Cormorant fishing into England as a sport, but failed (cf. Wright, <i>op.

The earliest drawings represent Ebisu holding a red <i>tai</i> (<i>Chrysophis
cardinalis</i>) in one hand, and a fishing-rod in the other. In popular
sketches he is usually shown with a laughing countenance, watching
the struggles of the <i>tai</i> at the end of his line, or else banqueting
with his companion gods on the same fish. In placing a fisherman god
among the Seven Deities of Happiness the Japanese display shrewdness of
observation and skill in selection.</p></div>

middle of Lake Tung-t’ing. The ball was a fish’s bladder!</p></div>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
